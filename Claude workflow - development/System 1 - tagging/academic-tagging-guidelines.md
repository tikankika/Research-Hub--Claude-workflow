# AI-Assisted Academic Tagging: Enhanced Methodology Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing a rigorous AI-assisted academic tagging methodology based on recommendations from methodological analysis. The approach balances efficiency with academic credibility through systematic validation and quality control.

**Key Principle**: The tagging framework is **dynamic and content-driven**. Not every article requires tags in all categories. Quality and relevance take precedence over rigid adherence to tag counts. **Maximum 10 tags per article** - be selective and focus on the most important elements.

**Philosophy**: With only 10 tags allowed, every tag must earn its place. Choose tags that are:
- **Specific** rather than general
- **Informative** for finding and understanding the paper
- **Essential** to the research contribution
- **Present** in the abstract (not inferred)

**Prioritization when cutting tags**:
1. Keep main topic and primary method (foundation)
2. Keep most distinctive/novel concepts
3. Keep significant findings (if quantified)
4. Cut generic applications or vague results first
5. Cut theoretical framework if not central to contribution

## 1. Category Definitions and Coding Guidelines

### 1.1 Main Topic
**Definition**: The overarching research domain or field of study
- **Scope**: Broad disciplinary area (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Climate Science", "Educational Psychology")
- **Tag Count**: 1-3 tags maximum
- **Examples**: 
  - ✓ "Artificial Intelligence" for a paper on neural networks
  - ✗ "Neural network optimization" (too specific for main topic)

### 1.2 Key Concepts
**Definition**: Specific theories, principles, or phenomena central to the research
- **Scope**: Core conceptual building blocks used in the study
- **Tag Count**: 3-5 tags
- **Distinction from Main Topic**: More granular than field, less specific than methods
- **Examples**:
  - ✓ "Transfer learning", "Convolutional layers", "Backpropagation"
  - ✗ "AI" (too broad for key concept)

### 1.3 Methods
**Definition**: Research methodologies, analytical techniques, and experimental approaches
- **Scope**: How the research was conducted
- **Tag Count**: 2 tags
- **Include**: Data collection methods, analysis techniques, experimental designs
- **Examples**:
  - ✓ "Randomized controlled trial", "Thematic analysis", "Monte Carlo simulation"
  - ✗ "Research" (too vague)

### 1.4 Findings
**Definition**: Principal discoveries, results, or conclusions
- **Scope**: What was learned or demonstrated
- **Tag Count**: 3-5 tags
- **Focus**: Concrete outcomes rather than interpretations
- **Examples**:
  - ✓ "23% improvement in accuracy", "Significant correlation (p<0.01)"
  - ✗ "Interesting results" (too vague)

### 1.5 Theoretical Framework
**Definition**: Underlying theories or models guiding the research
- **Scope**: Established theories referenced or extended
- **Tag Count**: 1-3 tags
- **Note**: May be "None" for purely empirical studies
- **Examples**:
  - ✓ "Social Cognitive Theory", "Unified Theory of Acceptance"
  - ✗ "Theoretical" (incomplete)

### 1.6 Potential Applications
**Definition**: Practical uses or implementations of the research
- **Scope**: Real-world applications, not theoretical implications
- **Tag Count**: 2-4 tags
- **Examples**:
  - ✓ "Medical diagnosis systems", "Autonomous vehicle navigation"
  - ✗ "Could be useful" (too vague)

## 2. Reliability Testing Protocol

### 2.1 Initial Calibration (One-time setup)
1. Select 20 articles across different domains
2. Tag each article twice with 24-hour interval
3. Calculate intra-rater reliability (target: >80% consistency)
4. Document and resolve inconsistencies

### 2.2 Ongoing Validation
1. **Weekly**: Dual-code 10% of new articles (AI + manual)
2. **Monthly**: Calculate Cohen's Kappa (acceptable: ≥0.70)
3. **Quarterly**: Full methodology review and refinement

### 2.3 Disagreement Resolution
- Document all AI-human disagreements
- Identify patterns in disagreements
- Update prompts/guidelines to address systematic issues
- Maintain disagreement log for transparency

## 3. Controlled Vocabulary Development

**Philosophy**: Vocabularies should **emerge from the literature**, not control it. The goal is consistency in your own tagging, not forcing papers into predetermined categories.

**Important**: These vocabulary lists are **suggestive, not prescriptive**. They serve as examples and starting points to ensure consistency, but should not limit or constrain tagging. New terms should emerge naturally from the literature.

### 3.1 Initial Vocabulary Lists (Examples Only)

**Principle**: Use these as inspiration, but always prioritize the actual terminology used in the abstract. If a paper introduces new concepts or uses different terminology, use those terms.

**When NOT to use controlled vocabulary:**
- When authors introduce new concepts or terminology
- When field-specific nuances matter (e.g., "collaborative learning" vs "cooperation" vs "collaboration")
- When the abstract uses more precise or current terminology
- When forcing standardization would lose important distinctions

#### Research Methods Vocabulary (AIED/Education Focus)
```
These are EXAMPLES - add new methods as encountered:
- Randomized controlled trial
- Pre-post test design
- A/B testing
- Learning analytics
- Educational data mining
- Think-aloud protocol
- Design-based research
- [Add others as they appear in abstracts]
```

#### Theoretical Frameworks Vocabulary (Education)
```
Common frameworks - but use what authors reference:
- Constructivism
- Cognitive Load Theory
- ICAP Framework
- Bloom's Taxonomy
- Zone of Proximal Development
- [Expand based on literature]
```

#### AIED-Specific Concepts
```
Frequent concepts - let vocabulary grow organically:
- Knowledge tracing
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Personalized learning
- Student modeling
- Adaptive feedback
- [New concepts emerge regularly]
```

### 3.2 Synonym Management
**Purpose**: Track equivalent terms for consistency, not to restrict vocabulary.

Keep a simple log of synonyms you encounter:

**General Academic Terms:**
- "Machine Learning" = "ML" = "Machine-learning" 
- "Artificial Intelligence" = "AI"
- [Add pairs as you discover them]

**AIED-Specific Terms:**
- "Intelligent Tutoring System" = "ITS"
- "Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning" = "CSCL"
- "Massive Open Online Course" = "MOOC"
- [Expand based on actual usage in papers]

**Note**: If authors use a specific variant, keep their terminology. Synonym tracking is for your own consistency across articles.

### 3.3 Vocabulary Maintenance
- **Add new terms freely** as they appear in abstracts
- **Document emerging concepts** without forcing them into existing categories
- **Review quarterly** to identify patterns, not to restrict
- **Stay current** with field evolution - AIED terminology changes rapidly
- **Avoid over-standardization** - diversity in terminology can be informative

   - Check suggested vocabulary for consistency ideas
   - Verify only included categories have relevant content
   - Remove tags that stretch beyond abstract content
   - **Add new terms only if more important than existing ones**
   - **Prioritize authors' terminology over standardized terms**

## Appendix A: Sample AI Prompt Template

```
Please analyze this academic abstract and provide tags in the following categories. Only include categories where relevant information is clearly present in the abstract. **Maximum 10 total tags** - be selective and prioritize the most important elements.

1. Main Topic (1 tag, max 2 if interdisciplinary): The broad research field
2. Key Concepts (2-3 tags): Only the most essential theories or phenomena  
3. Methods (1 tag, max 2 if mixed methods): Primary research methodology
4. Findings (1-2 tags): Most significant results only
5. Theoretical Framework (0-1 tag): Main theory if explicitly mentioned
6. Potential Applications (1-2 tags): Clear real-world uses only

Focus on AIED, educational technology, and learning sciences terminology where applicable. Be specific and avoid overly broad terms. Quality over quantity - fewer precise tags are better than many vague ones.

## Appendix B: Reliability Calculation Guide

### Cohen's Kappa Calculation
```
κ = (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe)

Where:
Po = Observed agreement
Pe = Expected agreement by chance

Interpretation:
< 0.20 = Poor agreement
0.21-0.40 = Fair agreement
0.41-0.60 = Moderate agreement
0.61-0.80 = Substantial agreement
> 0.80 = Almost perfect agreement
```
