  abstract     = {PurposeThe primary purpose of this paper is to articulate the
                  pivotal function of phenomenographic analysis in advancing the
                  depth and breadth of insights into doctoral research in
                  educational studies. By examining the distinctive
                  contributions and advantages afforded by phenomenographic
                  analysis, the paper aims to highlight its profound capability
                  to reveal the intricacies and variegated dimensions of human
                  experiences and perceptions. It advocates for the integration
                  of phenomenographic analysis into social science research
                  methodologies to foster a deeper, more nuanced appreciation of
                  its utility and impact.Design/methodology/approachThis article
                  leverages empirical evidence from a specific educational
                  research project to provide an in-depth examination of
                  phenomenographic analysis. It meticulously outlines the
                  procedural application of this methodological approach,
                  showcasing how it enriches research outcomes by offering a
                  profound exploration of the complex layers and subtle
                  variations present within social phenomena. The study employs
                  phenomenographic analysis to amplify the nuanced understanding
                  and inherent value of research findings in educational
                  studies.FindingsThe findings demonstrate that phenomenographic
                  analysis significantly enriches research outcomes by offering
                  a comprehensive exploration of complex social phenomena. The
                  method’s capability to uncover the intricacies and variegated
                  dimensions of human experiences and perceptions enhances the
                  quality and relevance of research conducted within the domain.
                  By providing empirical evidence and detailed procedural
                  application, the paper illustrates how phenomenographic
                  analysis contributes to the enrichment of academic discourse
                  and elevates the caliber of research in the social
                  sciences.Originality/valueThis article offers invaluable
                  perspectives to both researchers and practitioners by
                  providing a comprehensive analysis of phenomenographic
                  methodology. It underscores the indispensable contribution of
                  phenomenographic analysis in fostering a deeper understanding
                  of educational research findings. The work advocates for its
                  integration into social science research methodologies,
                  highlighting its unique value in enhancing the quality and
                  relevance of research. By illuminating the method’s profound
                  capability to reveal complex human experiences, the paper
                  significantly contributes to the enrichment of academic
                  discourse in the social sciences.},

  abstract     = {High-quality mathematics education not only improves life
                  outcomes for individuals but also drives innovation and
                  progress across society. But what exactly constitutes
                  high-quality mathematics education? In this article, we
                  contribute to this discussion by focusing on arithmetic
                  fluency. The debate over how best to teach arithmetic has been
                  long and fierce. Should we emphasize memorization techniques
                  such as flashcards and timed drills or promote "thinking
                  strategies" via play and authentic problem solving? Too often,
                  recommendations for a "balanced" approach lack the depth and
                  specificity needed to effectively guide educators or inform
                  public understanding. Here, we draw on developmental cognitive
                  science, particularly Sfard's process-object duality and
                  Karmiloff-Smith's implicit-explicit knowledge continuum, to
                  present memorization and thinking strategies not as opposing
                  methods but as complementary forces. This framework enables us
                  to offer specific recommendations for fostering arithmetic
                  fluency based on the science of learning. We define arithmetic
                  fluency, provide evidence on its importance, describe the
                  cognitive structures and processes supporting it, and share
                  evidence-based guidance for promoting it. Our recommendations
                  include progress monitoring for early numeracy, providing
                  explicit instruction to teach important strategies and
                  concepts, implementing well-structured retrieval practice,
                  introducing time-limited practice only after students
                  demonstrate accuracy, and allocating sufficient time for
                  discussion and cognitive reflection. By blending theory,
                  evidence, and practical advice, we equip educators and
                  policymakers with the knowledge needed to ensure all children
                  have access to the opportunities needed to achieve arithmetic
                  fluency.},

                  learning in higher education. Many empirical studies have been
                  conducted to examine issues in delivering online courses;
                  however, few have synthesized prior studies and provided an
                  overview on issues in online courses. A review of literature
                  using Cooper’s framework was conducted to identify such
                  issues. Three major categories of findings were identified:
                  issues related to online learners, instructors, and content
                  development. Learners’ issues included learners’ expectations,
                  readiness, identity, and participation in online courses.
                  Instructors’ issues included changing faculty roles,
                  transitioning from face-to-face to online, time management,
                  and teaching styles. Content issues included the role of
                  instructors in content development, integration of multimedia
                  in content, role of instructional strategies in content
                  development, and considerations for content development. To
                  address these challenges in online education, higher education

                  practices in distance education is scarce. Approaching the
                  adult learner’s perspectives on how distance education is
                  perceived is key to informing future initiatives. This study
                  explores adult learners’ perception of distance education,
                  concentrating on aspects such as, social presence, course
                  structure, and perceived learning and satisfaction. A survey
                  was distributed to teachers ( n = 78) in five schools
                  organising adult distance education. Findings show that
                  teacher accessibility and course structure correlated
                  positively with social presence and perceived learning and
                  satisfaction. Overall, adult learners are satisfied with their
                  distance teaching. A challenge facing adult distance education
                  is to create a sense of social presence despite the high
                  demand for flexibility. Thus, we explored learner perceptions
                  of benefits and challenges in distance education and
                  structured these into social, cognitive, spatio-temporal,
                  emotional, and technical dimensions. Findings reveal that one
                  challenge in the social dimension was a lack of connection
                  with peers, and a benefit in the cognitive dimension referred
                  to autonomy and self-regulation. These findings are important
                  as educational institutions and policymakers may strive for
                  high flexibility, which in turn may lead to lower group
                  cohesion and a lack of social presence.},

  abstract     = {Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into educational contexts
                  presents a transformative potential for enhancing learning
                  experiences. This paper introduces CourseGPT, a generative AI
                  tool designed to support instructors and enhance the
                  educational experiences of undergraduate students. Built on
                  open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from Mistral AI,
                  CourseGPT offers continuous instructor support and regular
                  updates to course materials, enriching the learning
                  environment. By utilizing course-specific content, such as
                  slide decks and supplementary readings and references,
                  CourseGPT provides precise, dynamically generated responses to
                  student inquiries. Unlike generic AI models, CourseGPT allows
                  instructors to manage and control the responses, thus
                  extending the course scope without overwhelming details. The
                  paper demonstrates the application of CourseGPT using the CPR
                  E 431 - Basics of Information System Security course as a
                  pilot. This course, with its large enrollments and diverse
                  curriculum, serves as an ideal testbed for CourseGPT. The tool
                  aims to enhance the learning experience, accelerate feedback
                  processes, and streamline administrative tasks. The study
                  evaluates CourseGPT's impact on student outcomes, focusing on
                  correctness scores, context recall, and faithfulness of
                  responses. Results indicate that the Mixtral-8x7b model, with
                  a higher parameter count, outperforms smaller models,
                  achieving an 88.0\% correctness score and a 66.6\%
                  faithfulness score. Additionally, feedback from former
                  students and teaching assistants on CourseGPT's accuracy,
                  helpfulness, and overall performance was collected. The
                  outcomes revealed that a significant majority found CourseGPT
                  to be highly accurate and beneficial in addressing their
                  queries, with many praising its ability to provide timely and
                  relevant information.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence
                  (GenAI) has brought opportunities and new challenges to higher
                  education. Students need a high level of self‐regulated
                  learning to adapt to this change. However, it is difficult for
                  students to persist in self‐regulation without guidance.
                  Metacognitive support has a significant advantage in enhancing
                  self‐regulated learning, but fewer studies have explored the
                  effects of its role in GenAI environments. The purpose of this
                  study was to investigate the impacts of metacognitive support
                  on college students' self‐regulated learning and learning
                  experiences in a GenAI environment. A quasi‐experiment was
                  designed in which 68 college students were divided into two
                  groups. The experimental group (N = 35) received explicit
                  metacognitive support, while the control group (N = 33) did
                  not receive any metacognitive prompts. The experiment lasted 4
                  weeks. The study measured students' academic performance,
                  self‐regulated learning ability and learning experiences
                  (including cognitive load and technology acceptance). The
                  results indicate that in the GenAI environment, metacognitive
                  support, while not producing significant between‐group
                  differences in achievement, enhances students' self‐regulated
                  learning abilities particularly in terms of task strategy and
                  self‐evaluation, as well as optimizing their learning
                  experience. The study also found that students were at risk of
                  decreasing their level of self‐regulated learning if they
                  lacked metacognitive support in the GenAI environment. The
                  conclusion points out that GenAI supports learners to
                  accomplish learning tasks while potentially reducing
                  self‐regulated learning effectiveness, and that metacognitive
                  support is key to supporting effective regulation in learners'
                  GenAI environments. This study provides an important
                  theoretical and practical basis for how to better support
                  learners' learning in GenAI environments. Practitioner
                  notesWhat is already known about this topic SRL is vital for
                  effective learning in digital environments. Generative AI
                  tools, like ChatGPT, can enhance learning but require support.
                  Learners often struggle to apply SRL strategies without
                  guidance. What this paper adds Metacognitive support improves
                  SRL in Generative AI environments. It reduces cognitive load
                  and increases the perceived usefulness of AI tools. Structured
                  support leads to better academic outcomes. Implications for
                  practice and/or policy Teachers should integrate metacognitive
                  support when using AI tools. Teacher training should focus on
                  SRL strategies in tech‐rich settings. Policies should promote
                  ethical and effective AI use in education.},

                  (AI) presents both opportunities and challenges in higher
                  education. This study examines three key areas: (1) students’
                  use of ChatGPT, (2) their perceptions of its benefits and
                  costs, and (3) the differences in attitudes toward AI
                  integration in higher education between ChatGPT users and
                  non-users. A sample of 737 undergraduate students at a Spanish
                  university answered an online survey. The quantitative
                  analysis revealed a high prevalence of ChatGPT use for
                  academic and personal purposes, with students identifying its
                  24/7 accessibility as a major advantage, along with the
                  time-saving benefits it offers. However, concerns were raised
                  about potential costs, including the devaluation of university
                  education when students rely on ChatGPT to complete
                  assignments. Results indicate significant differences between
                  ChatGPT users and non-users: users generally support AI
                  integration in higher education, particularly in teaching
                  methods, while non-users often oppose its integration,
                  advocating for measures such as banning AI in universities.
                  Our study provides valuable insights into student perspectives
                  on the integration of ChatGPT in higher education, emphasizing
                  the contrasting viewpoints of users and non-users. The
                  findings underline the need for universities to actively
                  involve students in shaping policies on artificial
                  intelligence while offering targeted training to promote its
                  responsible and ethical use. Furthermore, universities should
                  support educators in adapting their teaching methodologies to
                  the digital era by incorporating innovative strategies that
                  enhance both teaching and learning.},

                  over-reliance affects students’ cognitive abilities.
                  Overreliance on AI occurs when users accept AI-generated
                  recommendations without question, leading to errors in task
                  performance in the context of decision-making. This typically
                  arises when individuals struggle to assess the reliability of
                  AI or how much trust to place in its suggestions. This
                  systematic review investigates how students’ over-reliance on
                  AI dialogue systems, particularly those embedded with
                  generative models for academic research and learning, affects
                  their critical cognitive capabilities including
                  decision-making, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning.
                  By using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
                  and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, our systematic review
                  evaluated a body of literature addressing the contributing
                  factors and effects of such over-reliance within educational
                  and research contexts. The comprehensive literature review
                  spanned 14 articles retrieved from four distinguished
                  databases: ProQuest, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Web of
                  Science. Our findings indicate that over-reliance stemming
                  from ethical issues of AI impacts cognitive abilities, as
                  individuals increasingly favor fast and optimal solutions over
                  slow ones constrained by practicality. This tendency explains
                  why users prefer efficient cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics,
                  even amidst the ethical issues presented by AI technologies.},

                  systematically analysing classroom dialogue for application
                  across a range of educational settings. The paper outlines the
                  development and refinement of a coding scheme that attempts to
                  represent and operationalise commonalities amongst some key
                  theorists in the field concerning productive forms of
                  educational dialogue. The team has tested it using video
                  recordings from classroom settings in the UK and Mexico,
                  across age phases, subject areas, and different interactional
                  contexts including whole class, group and paired work. Our
                  Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (SEDA) is situated
                  within a sociocultural paradigm, and draws on Hymes'
                  Ethnography of Communication to highlight the importance of
                  context. We examined how such a tool could be used in
                  practice. We found that concentrating on the ‘communicative
                  act’ to explore dialogue between participants was an
                  appropriate level of granularity, while clustering the 33
                  resulting codes according to function of the acts helped to
                  highlight dialogic sequences within lessons. We report on the
                  application of the scheme in two different learning contexts
                  and reflect on its fitness for purpose, including perceived
                  limitations. Development of specialised sub-schemes and a
                  version for teachers is underway.},

  abstract     = {In 2 separate studies, we found that college-age students
                  learned more when they collaboratively watched tutorial
                  dialogue-videos than lecture-style monologue-videos. In fact,
                  they can learn as well as the tutees in the dialogue-videos.
                  These results replicate similar findings in the literature
                  showing the advantage of dialogue-videos even when observers
                  watched them individually. However, having the observing
                  students watch collaboratively as dyads provided data to carry
                  out in-depth analyses of their conversations and activities in
                  order to understand why dialogue-videos are superior to
                  monologue-videos. Toward that goal, transcripts of video
                  dialogues and monologues, as well as peer-to-peer
                  conversations of the observing students collected in a prior
                  study, were analyzed using the ICAP (interactive,
                  constructive, active, passive) framework as a lens. Three sets
                  of analyses were carried out. The 1st set focused on the
                  content of the videos in terms of the tutors’ and the tutees’
                  moves. The 2nd set focused on the activities and behaviors of
                  the collaboratively observing dyads. The 3rd set focused on
                  the role of the tutees in the dialogue-videos in eliciting
                  constructive and interactive engagement from the observing
                  students. Our analyses suggest that dialogue-videos naturally
                  elicited more constructive and interactive engagement
                  behaviors from the observers than the monologue-videos, which
                  in turn mediated the observers’ own learning.},

                  integrated CI systems that support coordinated group problem
                  solving behaviour. We focus on pedagogies and infrastructure
                  and we argue that project-based learning provides a sound
                  basis for CI education, allowing for different forms of CI
                  behaviour to be integrated, including swarm behaviour,
                  stigmergy, and collaborative behaviour. We highlight CI
                  technologies already being used in educational environments
                  while also pointing to opportunities and needs for further
                  creative designs to support the development of CI capabilities
                  across the lifespan. We argue that CI education grounded in
                  dialogue and the application of CI methods across a range of
                  project-based learning challenges can provide a common bridge
                  for diverse transitions into public and private sector jobs
                  and a shared learning experience that supports cooperative
                  public-private partnerships, which can further reinforce
                  advanced human capabilities in system design.},

  abstract     = {Buber’s distinction between the ‘I-It’ mode and the ‘I-Thou’
                  mode is seminal for dialogic education. While Buber intro-
                  duces the idea of dialogic space, an idea which has proved
                  useful for the analysis of dialogic education with technology,
                  his account fails to engage adequately with the role of
                  technology. This paper offers an introduction to the
                  significance of the I-It/I-Thou duality of technology in
                  relation with opening dialogic space. This is followed by a
                  short schematic history of educational technology which
                  reveals the role technology plays, not only in opening
                  dialogic space, but also in expand- ing dialogic space. The
                  expansion of dialogic space is an expansion of what it means
                  to be ‘us’ as dialogic engagement facilitates the
                  incorporation, into our shared sense of identity, of aspects
                  of reality that are initially experienced as alien or ‘other’.
                  Augmenting Buber with an alternative understanding of dialogic
                  space enables us to see how dialogue mediated by technology,
                  as well as dialogue with monologised fragments of technology
                  (robots), can, through education, lead to an expansion of what
                  it means to be human.},

                  stand the learning taking place in such complex environments

                  a new 13-category coding scheme, ‘Tech- SEDA’. This is the

                  practitioner professional development in this area are
                  inconsistent and often dependent on costly, external input.
                  Our study aimed to understand whether and how practitioner‐led
                  inquiry may offer an alternative, sustainable and scalable way
                  of developing dialogic practices, characterising effective
                  organisational models. The Teacher Scheme for Educational
                  Dialogue Analysis (T‐SEDA) resource pack was designed to
                  support iterative cycles of practitioner inquiry based on
                  systematic analysis of classroom dialogue and reflecting
                  critically with peers, using customisable coding tools and
                  templates. This open resource embeds research findings about
                  dialogue forms that are productive for student learning. We
                  report our design‐based research comprising nested inquiry
                  cycles involving 74 practitioners from early years to tertiary
                  levels. Data were derived from surveys, inquiry reports and
                  interviews. Participants successfully used and adapted the
                  resources for their own goals, needs and diverse contexts
                  across seven countries. The largely autonomous process was
                  typically supported by local facilitators working with groups
                  of practitioners; data analysis focused on illuminating models
                  of institutional organisation of inquiry, uses of T‐SEDA
                  resources, participant perceptions and factors underlying
                  (dis)engagement. The findings offer insights into knowledge
                  mobilisation and educational change processes. They yield
                  design principles for scalability and sustainability based on
                  a non‐prescriptive model of local ownership and facilitation
                  of self‐directed practitioner inquiry and purpose‐driven

                  ChatGPT-generated content has been criticized for sometimes
                  producing false, biased, and/or hallucinatory information. To
                  evaluate AI's ability to return clear and accurate anatomy
                  information, this study generated a custom interactive and
                  intelligent chatbot (Anatbuddy) through an Open AI Application
                  Programming Interface (API) that enables seamless AI-driven
                  interactions within a secured cloud infrastructure. Anatbuddy
                  was programmed through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
                  method to provide context-aware responses to user queries
                  based on a predetermined knowledge base. To compare their
                  outputs, various queries (i.e., prompts) on thoracic anatomy
                  (n = 18) were fed into Anatbuddy and ChatGPT 3.5. A panel
                  comprising three experienced anatomists evaluated both tools'
                  responses for factual accuracy, relevance, completeness,
                  coherence, and fluency on a 5-point Likert scale. These
                  ratings were reviewed by a third party blinded to the study,
                  who revised and finalized scores as needed. Anatbuddy's
                  factual accuracy (mean ± SD = 4.78/5.00 ± 0.43; median = 5.00)
                  was rated significantly higher (U = 84, p = 0.01) than
                  ChatGPT's accuracy (4.11 ± 0.83; median = 4.00). No
                  statistically significant differences were detected between
                  the chatbots for the other variables. Given ChatGPT's current
                  content knowledge limitations, we strongly recommend the
                  anatomy profession develop a custom AI chatbot for anatomy
                  education utilizing a carefully curated knowledge base to
                  ensure accuracy. Further research is needed to determine
                  students' acceptance of custom chatbots for anatomy education

                  ability to engage in conversations that resemble human
                  interactions, have been increasingly applied to language
                  teaching. Most recent review studies overlook student learning
                  outcomes and the methods to achieve these outcomes in
                  chatbot-supported language learning. Activity Theory (AT)
                  offers a framework of elements and functions inside an
                  activity system to accomplish desired objectives. This
                  systematic study intends to specify student learning outcomes
                  in a chatbot-supported setting and explain how various factors
                  such as rules, tools, and division of labor work together to
                  enhance learning outcomes in this environment. This review
                  included 37 papers published from January 2014 to January
                  2025. The findings provide two empirical contributions: the
                  four types of outcomes and the use of AT-based approaches to
                  achieve these outcomes. Additionally, two practical
                  suggestions are made: creating instructional design models for
                  teacher-AI collaboration in chatbot-assisted language learning
                  and developing professional AI chatbots for language
                  education. Furthermore, five research directions are proposed:
                  teacher-AI chatbot interactions, agentic outcomes,
                  out-of-school context, chatbot and human-chatbot
                  collaborations, and K-12 education setting. The findings
                  indicate how to use factors from AT to assist students leaning
                  language effectively with AI chatbots.},

                  and been studied to facilitate student learning experiences.
                  Motivation is crucial to almost every aspect of student
                  learning, yet how chatbots support student motivation remains
                  largely unexplored. This scoping review summarizes the
                  empirical research on using chatbots to promote student
                  motivation in learning. With a systematic analysis of 43
                  relevant studies published between 1966 and 2023, we addressed
                  five aspects: (1) underlying theories; (2) motivational
                  outcomes investigated; (3) intervention designs; (4)
                  relationship between chatbots and student motivation; and (5)
                  chatbot characteristics. The results showed thirty-one studies
                  used at least one of 26 theoretical models to explain
                  motivation or design chatbots. Engagement, interest, and
                  intrinsic motivation were the most investigated among 32
                  motivational variables. Quantitative research, with
                  self-report questionnaires, was the primary method, with four
                  longitudinal studies. The student-chatbot conversation
                  durations ranged from a few minutes to several months.
                  Overall, chatbot interactions positively correlated with
                  student motivation, although sustained interest was related to
                  prior human interactions. Chatbots generally outperformed
                  non-chatbot conditions but lagged interventions involving
                  human feedback or pedagogical approaches. Although primarily
                  text-based, recent chatbots feature diverse capabilities and
                  generative technologies for enhanced interactivity. This
                  review concludes with a call for future research to address
                  methodological limitations and understanding motivation as a
                  long-term, dynamic factor in chatbot-supported learning.},

                  AI chatbot capability. The capability of AI chatbots
                  significantly influences the adoption of AI chatbots for
                  learning effectiveness. The findings indicated that AI chatbot
                  capability mediates the effect of PU, PEU, and TC on the
                  adoption of AI chatbots; however, there is no mediating effect
                  in the relationship between SN and AI chatbot capability.
                  Facilitating conditions moderate the effect of PU and TC on AI
                  chatbot capability. This research addresses a new insight into
                  AI chatbot adoption within the context of higher education,
                  particularly demonstrating the mediating and moderating
                  function of AI chatbot capability and adoption on students’

  abstract     = {Abstract Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
                  particularly generative AI models such as ChatGPT, offer
                  transformative opportunities to enhance educational practices
                  in STEM disciplines. Thermodynamics, a fundamental subject in
                  engineering education, presents significant challenges due to
                  its abstract nature and common misconceptions. This study
                  investigates the effectiveness of integrating ChatGPT as a
                  supplemental pedagogical tool, guided by a constructivist
                  inquiry-based approach using the Constructivist Inquiry-Based
                  Learning Prompting (CILP) framework, to enhance conceptual
                  understanding and address misconceptions in an introductory
                  thermodynamics course for first-year Moroccan engineering
                  students. A quasi-experimental design was used, with 120
                  students equally divided into control and experimental groups.
                  The control group received traditional instruction, whereas
                  the experimental group received ChatGPT-assisted instruction.
                  Conceptual understanding was measured using pre- and
                  post-tests, while student perceptions and acceptance were
                  collected via weekly surveys. Results showed that the
                  experimental group significantly outperformed the control
                  group, exhibiting greater improvements in conceptual
                  understanding and a reduction in qualitative misconceptions,
                  particularly related to entropy and internal energy. However,
                  some quantitative misconceptions persisted, underscoring
                  ChatGPT’s limitations in advanced reasoning tasks,
                  problem-solving, and numerical calculations. Students reported
                  high satisfaction with ChatGPT’s usability and instructional
                  support. Moreover, targeted use of ChatGPT, rather than
                  frequent reliance, correlated with optimal learning outcomes.
                  These findings underscore ChatGPT’s potential to enhance STEM
                  education within inquiry-based, constructivist learning
                  environments and provide evidence for the effective
                  integration of generative AI tools to improve learning
                  outcomes, particularly in resource-constrained settings.},

  abstract     = {AbstractThe rapid development of generative artificial
                  intelligence (GenAI) technologies has sparked widespread
                  discussions about their potential applications in higher
                  education. However, little is known about how students from
                  various disciplines engage with GenAI tools. This study
                  explores undergraduate students' GenAI knowledge, usage
                  intentions, and task-specific engagement across academic
                  disciplines. Using a disciplinary categorization framework, we
                  examine how the hard/soft and pure/applied dimensions relate
                  to students' interactions with GenAI. We surveyed 193
                  undergraduates from diverse disciplines at a university in
                  Singapore. The questionnaire assessed students' GenAI
                  knowledge, usage intentions, and engagement with GenAI for
                  cognitive and routine tasks against their disciplinary
                  background. The results indicate substantial disciplinary
                  disparities in the level of engagement of students with GenAI.
                  Compared to pure fields, applied fields (both hard and soft)
                  consistently exhibit higher levels of GenAI knowledge and
                  utilization intentions. Furthermore, the engagement of GenAI
                  in routine tasks is relatively consistent across disciplines;
                  however, there are substantial disparities in cognitive tasks,
                  with applied fields exhibiting higher engagement. These
                  results suggest that the practical orientation of applied
                  fields drives GenAI adoption and utilization in academic
                  settings. The study emphasizes considering disciplinary
                  differences to better integrate GenAI into higher education
                  and calls for tailored approaches that align with each field's
                  unique epistemological and methodological traditions to
                  balance GenAI's practical benefits with the preservation of
                  core disciplinary knowledge and skills.},

                  history in both research and fiction and has been applied in
                  educational settings since the 1970s. However, the topic of AI
                  underwent a huge increase of interest with the release of
                  ChatGPT in late 2022, and more people were talking about
                  generative AI (GenAI or GAI). According to some estimates, the
                  number of publications on generative AI increased with
                  2269.49\% between 2022 and 2023, and the increase was even
                  higher when related to computing education. The aim of this
                  study is to investigate the potential strengths, weaknesses,
                  opportunities, and threats of generative AI in computing
                  education, as highlighted by research published after the
                  release of ChatGPT. The study applied a scoping literature
                  review approach with a three-step process for identifying and
                  including a total of 129 relevant research papers, published
                  in 2023 and 2024, through the Web of Science and Scopus
                  databases. Included papers were then analyzed with a
                  theoretical thematic analysis, supported by the SWOT analysis
                  framework, to identify themes of strengths, weaknesses,
                  opportunities, and threats with generative AI for computing
                  education. A total of 19 themes were identified through the

                  practical implications for computing education specifically,
                  and higher education in general. Findings highlights several
                  challenges posed by generative AI, such as potential biases,
                  overreliance, and loss of skills; but also several
                  possibilities, such as increasing motivation, educational
                  transformation, and supporting teaching and learning. The

  abstract     = {Abstract Generative AI (genAI) chatbots can be a powerful tool
                  for learning, especially self-regulated learning, but they can
                  also add more complexity to the learning process because of
                  their numerous capabilities. Learners might not make use of
                  these capabilities and fail to profit from them. One core
                  genAI affordance is to adapt any learning material to the
                  learner’s individual needs. To help learners make use of these
                  adaptation capabilities, instructional prompts can help, but
                  they can also have negative effects on cognitive load. This
                  study investigated K-12 learners’ perceptions and interaction
                  patterns with a chatbot, focusing on their use of content
                  adaptation capabilities. In this experimental study with 106
                  secondary school students, a group receiving adaptation
                  guidance (including brief instruction, prompt suggestions, and
                  adjustable chatbot response length and language level) was
                  compared to a control group without adaptation guidance.
                  Results show that learners perceived chatbots as easy to use
                  despite limited prior experience. Without guidance, they
                  underutilized the chatbot’s adaptation capabilities. The
                  experimental group used twice as many adaptation prompts (M =
                  6.0) compared to the control group (M = 2.5), without
                  experiencing increased cognitive load. Interestingly, both
                  groups showed similar knowledge gains and reported high
                  satisfaction levels. These findings suggest that easily
                  implementable interventions can enhance students’ use of genAI
                  chatbot capabilities, potentially improving their
                  self-regulated learning experiences. Future research should
                  explore the long-term effects of adaptation guidance on
                  learning outcomes and self-regulated learning skills.},

                  We used quasi-experiments to compare the performance of
                  dialogue dynamics, learner perceptions, and practical
                  competencies in CPS during students’ interactions with: (1) a
                  GAI chatbot, and (2) their peers. In total, 80 postgraduate
                  students participated. The assigned CPS task was the creation
                  of an innovative research proposal. We found that there were
                  significant differences in the dialogic exchanges observed
                  between the two types of interaction. Student-GAI chatbot
                  interactions featured more knowledge-based dialogue and
                  elaborate discussions, with less subjective expression
                  compared to student-peer interactions. Notably, students
                  contributed significantly less dialogue when interacting with
                  a GAI chatbot than they did during peer interactions. The
                  dialogic exchanges arising from student-GAI chatbot
                  interactions tended to follow distinct patterns, while those
                  from student-peer interactions were less predictable. The
                  students perceived interacting with a GAI chatbot as more
                  useful and easier than interacting with peers. Furthermore,
                  they exhibited higher intention levels when utilising a GAI
                  chatbot to tackle the CPS task compared to engaging in
                  discussions with their peers. Ultimately, practical
                  performance was significantly enhanced through interactions
                  with a GAI chatbot. This study implies that the prudent use of
                  GAI-based techniques can facilitate university students’
                  learning achievement.},

                  metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and
                  emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                  extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                  variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                  volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                  comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                  become one of the most important areas of research within
                  educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                  analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne
                  and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and
                  Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the
                  following aspects: (a) history and development, (b)
                  description of the model (including the model figures), (c)
                  empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on
                  the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of
                  aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how
                  they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion,
                  (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In
                  the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                  meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                  extracted. Further, four future lines of research are
                  proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the
                  SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from
                  which to conduct research and on which students can be taught
                  to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the
                  available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential
                  effects of SRL models in light of differences in students'

                  enabled new forms of human-AI interaction. In this work, we
                  explored the utility of using generative AI, specifically
                  OpenAI’s ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
                  3.5, to support the design thinking process to identify user
                  needs, ideate, and refine solutions. We examined how 17
                  students and profession- als from a design program engaged in
                  reflective design practices and self-regulated learning (SRL),
                  as they used generative AI to brainstorm ideas. We further
                  explored how participants considered, elaborated upon, and

                  Analyses involved qualitative coding of the brainstorming

                  individualized learning environment, and may have the
                  potential to motivate student self-regulated learning (SRL),
                  more effectively than other non-AI technologies. However, the
                  impact of ChatGPT on student motivation, SRL, and needs
                  satisfaction is unclear. Motivation and the SRL process can be
                  explained using self-determination theory (SDT) and the three
                  phases of forethought, performance, and self-reflection,
                  respectively. Accordingly, a Delphi design was employed in
                  this study to determine how ChatGPT-based learning activities
                  satisfy students’ each SDT need, and foster each SRL phase
                  from a teacher perspective. We involved 36 SDT school teachers
                  with extensive expertise in technology enhanced learning to
                  develop a classification tool for learning activities that
                  affect student needs satisfaction and SRL phases using
                  ChatGPT. We collaborated with the teachers in three rounds to
                  investigate and identify the activities, and we revised
                  labels, descriptions, and explanations. The major finding is
                  that a classification tool for 20 learning activities using
                  ChatGPT was developed. The tool suggests how ChatGPT better
                  satisfy SDT-based needs, and fosters the three SRL phrases.
                  This classification tool can assist researchers in
                  replicating, implementing, and integrating successful ChatGPT
                  in education research and development projects. The tool can
                  inspire teachers to modify the activities using generative AI

                  systematically analyzes the impact of generative AI on these
                  skills using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
                  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to identify,
                  evaluate, and synthesize relevant studies. Document searches
                  were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect,
                  focusing on publications from 2022 to 2024, when ChatGPT was
                  first widely adopted. Of the 3,214 documents identified, 557
                  met the initial screening criteria, and 38 studies were
                  selected for detailed analysis. The findings reveal that
                  71.4\% of studies reported AI’s positive role in SRL, mainly
                  through personalized learning, metacognitive support, and
                  adaptive feedback. Likewise, 62.5\% of studies reported its
                  significant role in critical thinking, supporting the process
                  of analysis, evaluation, and reflection. However, researchers
                  cautioned against an overreliance on technology, which one
                  said could take away some students’ ability to think for

                  empirical studies, we employed a qualitative approach to
                  scrutinize AI's role in supporting SRL processes. Through a
                  meticulous selection process adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we
                  identified 14 distinct studies that leveraged AI applications,
                  including chatbots, adaptive feedback systems, serious games,
                  and e-textbooks, to support student autonomy. Our findings

                  facilitating SRL's forethought, performance, and reflection
                  phases, yet also highlights whether the agency is
                  human-centered or AI-centered leading to variations in the SRL

  abstract    = {Using machines to support self-regulated learning (SRL), i.e.,
                 how learners systematically activate and sustain their
                 cognitions, motivations, behaviours, and affects to attain
                 their learning goals, has been an aim of educational
                 technologies for decades. However, the theoretical models of
                 SRL do not sufficiently conceptualise the active role
                 technology may play today when learners engage in discussions
                 with artificial intelligence (AI) models and teachers use
                 technological tools to automate or augment pedagogical tasks.
                 An inadequate conceptualisation of the role of technology may
                 lead to unwanted effects, such as learners offloading the
                 regulation of the learning process to the technology. This gap
                 is addressed in this dissertation by first exploring the
                 perspectives of the learner, the teacher, and technology in
                 contexts in which technology provides external regulatory
                 support (Studies I-IV). Building on these studies and previous
                 research, a conceptual model integrating the active roles of a
                 learner, a teacher, and technology in the SRL process is
                 introduced. In Studies I and II, design science research
                 methodology was used to build and evaluate a technology
                 artefact (a structured learning diary) aimed to support
                 learners’ SRL. While this artefact was sufficient in capturing
                 cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects of SRL, in a
                 randomised controlled trial, the intervention did not have an
                 effect on SRL, and even had adverse effects on study engagement
                 among a subgroup of learners. In Study III, learners'
                 willingness to disclose data for learning analytics (LA)
                 systems and to opt-in for LA-based SRL support was investigated
                 using a partial correlation network and logistic regression.
                 Although learners were hesitant to disclose especially
                 sensitive and process data to LA systems, most learners opted
                 in for LA-based SRL support. In Study IV, Finnish education
                 practitioners' views about adaptive learning technologies were
                 analysed using epistemic network analysis on posts in social
                 media. Based on the analysis, teachers’ support for adaptive
                 learning technologies focuses on efficiency, whereas the
                 critique focuses on the importance of human presence. Based on
                 the experiences gained in Studies I-IV, I introduce a
                 conceptual model on the locus of regulation, in which the role
                 of technology is seen as a pedagogical agent and the primary
                 source for regulatory activity may be situated with the
                 learner, the teacher, or technology – or shared between these
                 in a range of combinations. This conceptualisation underlines
                 the difference between scaffolding for SRL (targeting a gradual
                 transfer of regulation responsibility from the technology to
                 the learner) and offloading the regulation from the learner to
                 the technology. Keywords: self-regulated learning, learning

                  shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in the online
                  collaborative learning (OCL) context presents challenges that
                  the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
                  may help solve. However, the effective uses of AI to support
                  multifaceted areas (cognition, metacognition, and motivation)
                  and phases (forethought, performance, and reflection) of SSRL
                  remain elusive. Furthermore, research on developing an
                  educational AI and what pedagogical attributes and elements
                  are required for AI to support students' SSRL effectively is
                  limited. This study, therefore, aims to investigate students'
                  perceptions of AI applications in enhancing SSRL and to
                  explore the essential pedagogical elements necessary for AI to
                  support SSRL during the OCL. To achieve these aims, the study
                  conducted Focus Group Interviews facilitated by 9 scenarios of
                  AI application storyboards and paper prototypes with 30
                  undergraduate and graduate students. The study findings show
                  that students perceive various types of AI to support
                  cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational areas across
                  different SSRL phases. The study also found that students
                  viewed AI as an active learning agent, serving in roles
                  previously inhabited solely by human educators and students.
                  Furthermore, the study reveals seven key pedagogical elements
                  across TPACK components such as pedagogical, content,
                  technological, pedagogical content, technological pedagogical,
                  technological content, and technological pedagogical content

  abstract   = {Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control
                and reflect on one’s problem-solving process. Prior research has
                shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve
                novice performance in solving programming problems. However,
                with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate
                fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and
                hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies
                such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this
                position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that
                generative AI technologies pose for novices’ self-regulation
                strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We be-
                lieve that the key challenge facing educators is that such
                technolo- gies may hamper novices’ ability to regulate their
                programming problem solving process. On the other hand, these
                technologies also open up the possibil- ity to design new
                interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We
                draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning
                theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework
                that incorporates use of generative AI tools in program- ming
                problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides

                  deliver quick and meaningful evaluation of student learning
                  outcomes. However, current versions of GAI tools have
                  considerable limitations, such as social biases often inherent
                  in the data sets used to train the models. Moreover, the GAI
                  revolution comes during a period of moving away from
                  memorization-based education systems toward supporting
                  learners in developing the ability to apply knowledge and
                  skills to solve real-world problems and explain real-world
                  phenomena. A challenge in using GAI tools for scoring
                  assessments aimed at fostering knowledge application is
                  ensuring that these algorithms are scoring the same construct
                  attributes (e.g., knowledge and skills) as a trained human
                  scorer would score when evaluating student performance.
                  Similarly, if using GAI tools to develop assessments, one
                  needs to ensure that the goals of GAI-generated assessments
                  are aligned with the vision and performance expectations of
                  the learning environments for which these assessments are
                  developed. Currently, no guidelines have been identified for
                  assessing the validity of AI-based assessments and assessment
                  results. This paper represents a conceptual analysis of issues
                  related to developing and validating GAI-based assessments and
                  assessment results to guide the learning process. Our primary
                  focus is to investigate how to meaningfully leverage
                  capabilities of GAI for developing assessments. We propose
                  ways to evaluate the validity evidence of GAI-produced
                  assessments and assessment scores based on existing validation
                  approaches. We discuss future research avenues aimed at
                  establishing guidelines and methodologies for assessing the
                  validity of AI-based assessments and assessment results. We

                  plagiarism in higher education from a global perspective and
                  developed strategies for reducing these
                  behaviours.Design/methodology/approachThe study followed the
                  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
                  Meta-Analysis reporting guidelines to select 26 research
                  articles published between 2016 and 2024.FindingsCheating and
                  plagiarism are caused by laziness, time constraints, lack of
                  confidence, difficult exams, excessive assignments, fear of
                  poor grades, and motivation to achieve higher grades. However,
                  students are often unaware of the effects these behaviours can
                  have on their academic and professional careers. Therefore, in
                  addition to regularly updating academic honour codes following
                  national laws and regulations, higher education institutions
                  need to introduce training programmes and workshops to raise
                  students’ awareness of the negative consequences of cheating
                  and plagiarism, enhance their writing skills, and promote
                  positive attitudes.Practical implicationsThe study findings
                  may assist policymakers and stakeholders in higher education
                  institutions in deciding whether to implement academic
                  integrity education programmes and modify honour codes
                  following government laws and regulations. Additionally, this
                  study contributes to the existing literature on cheating and
                  plagiarism and will help higher education institutions address
                  the root causes of these behaviours.Originality/valueThis

                  artificial intelligence with natural language processing
                  capabilities, on higher education. ChatGPT, which is able to
                  make human-like responses, with its scalability,
                  customizability, automated conversations, efficiency,
                  cost-effectiveness, natural language processing, and language
                  translation capability, can be an ideal tool for different
                  functions, including the academic learning process. However,
                  ChatGPT may allow students to cheat on their assignments in
                  class quickly. Students can easily use this tool to find
                  correct answers in their exams, complete assignment papers,
                  etc. This raises several legal and ethical issues, such as
                  copyright, plagiarism, and fairness in education. This
                  seriously threatens academic integrity and can significantly
                  reduce students' learning achievements. Therefore, it is
                  essential to study the impact of ChatGPT on students' learning
                  process. While the benefits of integrating ChatGPT into the
                  learning environment have been proven, finding challenges and
                  determining how ChatGPT can advance learning is essential. In
                  this context, this paper studies 1) the possible benefits and
                  challenges of ChatGPT on students' academic integrity in the
                  classroom and 2) the strategies that can be adopted to address
                  the challenges of ChatGPT created in the academic environment.
                  Based on an extensive review of relevant literature, this
                  study found that ChatGPT should not be prohibited but rather
                  embraced in higher education with ethical and responsible use.

                  education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality
                  as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of
                  this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating
                  and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to
                  cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this
                  recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45
                  articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA
                  guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the
                  papers. This review shows that factors such as increased
                  pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack
                  of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical
                  application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to
                  cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these
                  factors are classified as individual, social, cultural,
                  institutional, and technological factors that are responsible
                  for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing
                  ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating
                  up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore,
                  higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism
                  detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid
                  students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing

                  artificial intelligence (AI), have significantly transformed
                  educational practices. Recently, the development and adoption
                  of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly
                  OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked considerable interest. The
                  unprecedented capabilities of these models, such as generating
                  humanlike text and facilitating automated conversations, have
                  broad implications in various sectors, including education and
                  health. Despite their immense potential, concerns regarding
                  their widespread use and opacity have been raised within the
                  scientific community. ChatGPT, the latest version of the GPT
                  series, has displayed remarkable proficiency, passed the US
                  bar law exam, and amassed over a million subscribers shortly
                  after its launch. However, its impact on the education sector
                  has elicited mixed reactions, with some educators heralding it
                  as a progressive step and others raising alarms over its
                  potential to reduce analytical skills and promote misconduct.
                  This paper aims to delve into these discussions, exploring the
                  potential and problems associated with applying advanced AI
                  models in education. It builds on extant literature and

                  acquire new forms of AI literacy, including an understanding
                  of responsible use of AI. In this study, we explored tensions
                  in teachers’ and students’ opinions about what constitutes
                  learning and cheating with AI. Using qualitative methods, we
                  asked Pre-K through postsecondary writing teachers (n = 16)
                  and a linguistically diverse group of students (n = 12) to
                  consider examples of how students might use ChatGPT, rank them
                  in order of how much they thought each student learned and
                  cheated, and explain their rankings. Our study yielded three
                  findings. First, teachers and students used similar criteria
                  to determine their rankings. Second, teachers and students
                  arrived at similar conclusions about learning with ChatGPT but
                  different conclusions about cheating. Finally, disagreements
                  centered on four main tensions between (1) using ChatGPT as a
                  shortcut versus as a scaffold; (2) using ChatGPT to generate
                  ideas versus language; (3) getting support from ChatGPT versus
                  analogous support from other sources; and (4) learning from
                  ChatGPT versus learning without. These findings underscore the
                  importance of student voice in co-constructing norms around

                  when exams of similar difficulty were administered in person
                  (pre-Covid) versus online. The format, difficulty, and grading
                  of the exams was the same throughout. Although randomized
                  controlled experiments are generally more effective than
                  observational studies, we will indicate when we present the
                  data why experiments would not be feasible for this research.
                  In addition to presenting experimental findings, the paper
                  offers some insights, based on the author's extensive
                  experience, to guide educators in crafting more secure online
                  assessments in this new era, both for courses at the
                  introductory level and more advances courses The results and
                  findings are relevant to introductory courses that can use
                  multiple choice exams in any subject but the recommendations
                  for upper-level courses will be relevant primarily to STEM
                  subjects. The research underscores the pressing need for
                  reinventing assessment techniques to uphold the sanctity of
                  online education.},

                  concerns about academic integrity and grade inflation,
                  especially given the rise of artificial intelligence–powered
                  tools. Objective This study evaluates the validity of
                  unmonitored online exams by comparing student performance
                  between two sections of an undergraduate personality
                  psychology course: one section completed an unmonitored online
                  multiple-choice final exam while the other completed an
                  in-person multiple-choice final exam. Method A
                  quasi-experimental design was used with two undergraduate
                  personality psychology course sections. Section 1 (Spring
                  2022, n = 153) took an in-person final exam, while Section 2
                  (Spring 2023, n = 160) took an unmonitored online final exam.
                  Both sections completed identical in-person exams throughout
                  the semester. Results Online final exam scores were
                  significantly higher than the in-person final exam scores. The
                  correlation between regular in-person exams was strong for the
                  in-person final exam but weak for the online final exam. Exam
                  format was a stronger predictor of final exam scores than
                  prior performance. Conclusion Unmonitored online exams lead to
                  inflated scores and may not reflect students’ true abilities.
                  Teaching Implications Educators should reconsider using
                  unmonitored online exams for high-stakes assessments and
                  explore alternative methods or enhanced monitoring to maintain
                  academic integrity.},

                  self-reflective strategy was developed for invoking critical
                  thinking and higher-order reasoning in LLMs when responding to
                  complex multimodal exam questions involving both visual and
                  textual data. The proposed strategy was demonstrated and
                  evaluated on real exam questions by subject experts and the
                  performance of ChatGPT (GPT-4) with vision was estimated on an

  abstract     = {Generative AI (hereinafter GenAI) technology, such as ChatGPT,
                  is already influencing the higher education sector. In this
                  work, we focused on the impact of GenAI on the academic
                  integrity of assessments within higher education institutions,
                  as GenAI can be used to circumvent assessment approaches
                  within the sector, compromising their quality. The purpose of
                  our research was threefold: first, to determine the extent to
                  which the use of GenAI can be detected via the marking and
                  moderation process; second, to understand whether the presence
                  of GenAI affects the marking process; and finally, to
                  establish whether authentic assessments can safeguard academic
                  integrity. We used a series of experiments in the context of
                  two UK‐based universities to examine these issues. Our
                  findings indicate that markers, in general, are not able to
                  distinguish assessments that have had GenAI input from
                  assessments that did not, even though the presence of GenAI
                  affects the way markers approach the marking process. Our
                  findings also suggest that the level of authenticity in an
                  assessment has no impact on the ability to safeguard against
                  or detect GenAI usage in assessment creation. In conclusion,
                  we suggest that current approaches to assessments in higher
                  education are susceptible to GenAI manipulation and that the
                  higher education sector cannot rely on authentic assessments
                  alone to control the impact of GenAI on academic integrity.
                  Thus, we recommend giving more critical attention to
                  assessment design and placing more emphasis on assessments
                  that rely on social experiential learning and are performative
                  rather than output‐based and asynchronously written.
                  Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic GenAI
                  has enabled students to complete higher education assessments
                  quickly and with good quality, leading to challenges in
                  academic integrity. GenAI has transformed the requirements and
                  considerations in assessment design in higher education.
                  Authentic assessments are seen as a prominent way to tackle
                  the GenAI challenge. What this paper adds We provide
                  quantitative and qualitative experimental evidence suggesting
                  that GenAI can generate authentic assessments that pass the
                  scrutiny of experienced academics. We demonstrate how the use
                  of authentic assessments alone does not protect the academic
                  integrity of students in higher education. Our qualitative
                  analysis indicates that markers may generate false positive
                  and false negative results if they suspect GenAI tampering in
                  an assessment. Thus, students' learning is not assessed
                  correctly. Implications for practice and/or policy When
                  universities and national organisations design policies
                  regarding GenAI, authentic assessments are not the panacea;
                  the focus must remain on assessment design. Assessments of
                  learning need to shift from assessing output to focusing on
                  process and relevance to the workplace. That would mean a
                  paradigmatic shift from written assessments to synchronous
                  interpersonal assessments. The move away from written
                  assessments has implications that are far reaching for the
                  academy if written assessments cannot be trusted as a reliable
                  indicator for and of learning.},

                  promise to align technology with moral and human values, the
                  dilemma of how AI may impact existing valuing practices is
                  often overlooked. To examine this gap, we conducted an
                  interview study with university teachers from different
                  disciplines at a university in Sweden. Following a
                  semi-structured study design, we explored university teachers’
                  anticipations of AI in assessment and examined how emerging AI

  abstract     = {CONTEXT: Constructed-response tasks, which range from
                  short-answer tests to essay questions, are included in
                  assessments of medical knowledge because they allow educators
                  to measure students' ability to think, reason, solve complex
                  problems, communicate and collaborate through their use of
                  writing. However, constructed-response tasks are also costly
                  to administer and challenging to score because they rely on
                  human raters. One alternative to the manual scoring process is
                  to integrate computer technology with writing assessment. The
                  process of scoring written responses using computer programs
                  is known as 'automated essay scoring' (AES). METHODS: An AES
                  system uses a computer program that builds a scoring model by
                  extracting linguistic features from a constructed-response
                  prompt that has been pre-scored by human raters and then,
                  using machine learning algorithms, maps the linguistic
                  features to the human scores so that the computer can be used
                  to classify (i.e. score or grade) the responses of a new group
                  of students. The accuracy of the score classification can be
                  evaluated using different measures of agreement. RESULTS:
                  Automated essay scoring provides a method for scoring
                  constructed-response tests that complements the current use of
                  selected-response testing in medical education. The method can
                  serve medical educators by providing the summative scores
                  required for high-stakes testing. It can also serve medical
                  students by providing them with detailed feedback as part of a
                  formative assessment process. CONCLUSIONS: Automated essay
                  scoring systems yield scores that consistently agree with
                  those of human raters at a level as high, if not higher, as
                  the level of agreement among human raters themselves. The
                  system offers medical educators many benefits for scoring
                  constructed-response tasks, such as improving the consistency
                  of scoring, reducing the time required for scoring and
                  reporting, minimising the costs of scoring, and providing
                  students with immediate feedback on constructed-response
                  tasks.},

  abstract     = {Generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as
                  ChatGPT, bring an unprecedented change in education by
                  leveraging the power of natural language processing and
                  machine learning. Employing ChatGPT to assist with marking
                  written assessment presents multiple advantages including
                  scalability, improved consistency, eliminating biases
                  associated with human subjectivity. This work aimed to
                  evaluate the usefulness, reliability and accuracy of ChatGPT
                  in marking written assessments of varied types and to identify
                  its limitations and challenges. ChatGPT was instructed using a
                  set of prompts to mark the assessment based on a rubric.
                  ChatGPT was able to evaluate and assess both coding and
                  reflective assessments and to distinguish between assignments
                  of different quality, demonstrating high consistency and
                  accuracy for higher quality assessments, comparable to a human
                  marking. ChatGPT was also able to generate textual detailed
                  justifications based on the rubric and assessment task
                  description. There was a significant difference in the
                  outcomes generated by different prompts. These preliminary
                  findings suggest that utilising ChatGPT as a marking assistant
                  can increase written assessment marking efficiency, reduce
                  cost and potentially decrease the unfairness and bias by
                  providing a moderating perspective. Implications for practice
                  or policy: Assessment designers could reconsider the design,
                  purpose and objectives of written assessments and leverage
                  ChatGPT effectively for teaching and learning. Assessors might
                  consider adapting the technology as a grading aid, to support
                  a human-in-the-loop grading process, providing additional
                  resources and time, moderating and refining individual
                  feedback, to increase consistency and quality. Curriculum and
                  programme leaders could develop guidelines around the ethical
                  use of generative AI-assisted assessment practice, monitor and
                  regulate the ongoing evaluation and refinement.},

                  While existing methods can score more structured math and
                  computer science assessments, they often do not provide
                  explanations for the scores. Our study focuses on employing
                  GPT-4 for automated assessment in middle school Earth Science,
                  combining few-shot and active learning with chain-of-thought
                  reasoning. Using a human-in-the-loop approach, we successfully
                  score and provide meaningful explanations for formative
                  assessment responses. A systematic analysis of our method's
                  pros and cons sheds light on the potential for

                  literature has not properly investigated how this technology
                  would impact assessment in higher education. This scoping
                  review took a forward-thinking approach to investigate how
                  generative artificial intelligence transforms assessment in
                  higher education. We used the PRISMA extension for scoping
                  reviews to select articles for review and report the results.
                  In the screening, we retrieved 969 articles and selected 32
                  empirical studies for analysis. Most of the articles were
                  published in 2023. We used three levels—students, teachers,
                  and institutions—to analyses the articles. Our results
                  suggested that assessment should be transformed to cultivate
                  students’ self-regulated learning skills, responsible
                  learning, and integrity. To successfully transform assessment
                  in higher education, the review suggested that (i) teacher
                  professional development activities for assessment, AI, and
                  digital literacy should be provided, (ii) teachers’ beliefs
                  about human and AI assessment should be strengthened, and
                  (iii) teachers should be innovative and holistic in their
                  teaching to reflect the assessment transformation. Educational
                  institutions are recommended to review and rethink their
                  assessment policies, as well as provide more
                  inter-disciplinary programs and teaching.},

                  assessment. On the one hand, this use offers opportunities for
                  teachers to practice assessment more effectively, and on the
                  other hand, it brings challenges to the design of
                  pedagogically sound and responsible digital assessment. There
                  is a lack of validated instruments and models that explain,
                  assess and support teachers' critical pedagogical practice of
                  digital assessment. This explorative work first develops and
                  validates a survey instrument to examine teachers' digital
                  assessment practices. Secondly, we build a model to
                  investigate to what extent teachers' pedagogical digital
                  assessment knowledge is a foundation for the future of digital
                  assessment (ie, authentic, accessible, automated, continuous
                  and responsible). A total of 219 university teachers at a
                  large European university participated in the survey study.
                  Factor exploratory analysis and structural equation modelling
                  were used to validate the reliability and validity of items
                  and internal causal relations of factors. The results show the
                  survey is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing
                  teachers' digital assessment practice in higher education.
                  Teachers' pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content
                  knowledge of digital assessment is critical, while teachers'
                  technological pedagogical knowledge seems to have a more
                  limited impact on the future of digital
                  assessment.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this
                  topic Digital technologies are increasingly used in assessment
                  in higher education. Teachers are the key stakeholders in the
                  assessment for learning. There is a limited transformative
                  nature of digital assessment practices. What this paper adds A
                  validated instrument to assess teachers' pedagogical practice
                  of digital assessment in higher education. Teachers'
                  pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge of digital
                  assessment is critical to the future of digital assessment.
                  Teachers' technological pedagogical knowledge of digital
                  assessment has a more limited impact on the future of digital
                  assessment. Implications for practice and policy Teachers need
                  to be supported in developing pedagogical digital assessment
                  practices in higher education. Based on this study's outcomes,
                  educators, institutions and policymakers can inform the design
                  and implementation of effective and responsible digital
                  assessment practices. The design and implementation of
                  responsible digital assessments will enhance the quality of
                  higher education in the digital age.},

                  readiness. However, the emergence of generative artificial
                  intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has significantly
                  disrupted traditional assessment processes, raising concerns
                  about academic integrity and necessitating innovative
                  approaches. While higher education institutions are making
                  strides in adapting to this new reality, the foundation of
                  effective assessment remains educators’ assessment literacy.
                  This paper responds to the critical need for improving
                  educators’ assessment literacy by introducing a comprehensive
                  model – the ‘AARDVARC’ framework – that outlines eight key
                  attributes of effective assessment: alignment, authenticity,
                  reliability, developmental appropriateness, validity,
                  accessibility, realism, and constructiveness. By fostering
                  assessment literacy, educators can design innovative,
                  equitable, and discipline-relevant assessments that
                  incorporate GenAI responsibly and meaningfully. The paper
                  further offers actionable recommendations for adapting
                  university assessments to align with institutional goals and
                  meet the evolving demands of the educational landscape. These
                  strategies aim to ensure that assessments continue to promote
                  student engagement, maintain academic standards, and reflect
                  the realities of modern education.},

                  performance of ChatGPT, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence
                  (AI) language model developed by OpenAI, in successfully
                  completing the French language version of the European Board
                  of Ophthalmology (EBO) examination and to assess its potential
                  role in medical education and knowledge assessment. METHODS:
                  ChatGPT, based on the GPT-4 architecture, was exposed to a
                  series of EBO examination questions in French, covering
                  various aspects of ophthalmology. The AI's performance was
                  evaluated by comparing its responses with the correct answers
                  provided by ophthalmology experts. Additionally, the study
                  assessed the time taken by ChatGPT to answer each question as
                  a measure of efficiency. RESULTS: ChatGPT achieved a 91\%
                  success rate on the EBO examination, demonstrating a high
                  level of competency in ophthalmology knowledge and
                  application. The AI provided correct answers across all
                  question categories, indicating a strong understanding of
                  basic sciences, clinical knowledge, and clinical management.
                  The AI model also answered the questions rapidly, taking only
                  a fraction of the time needed by human test-takers.
                  CONCLUSION: ChatGPT's performance on the French language
                  version of the EBO examination demonstrates its potential to
                  be a valuable tool in medical education and knowledge
                  assessment. Further research is needed to explore optimal ways
                  to implement AI language models in medical education and to
                  address the associated ethical and practical concerns.},

                  Recently, advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                  technologies have introduced transformative possibilities for
                  automating and personalising language
                  assessments.ObjectivesThis article aims to explore the design
                  and implementation of AI‐enabled assessment tools in language
                  education, filling the research gaps regarding the impact of
                  assessment type, intervention duration, education level, and
                  first language learner/second language learner (L1/L2) on the
                  effectiveness of AI‐enabled assessment tools in enhancing
                  students' language learning outcome.MethodsThis study
                  conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to examine 25
                  empirical studies from January 2012 to March 2024 from six
                  databases (including EBSCO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science,
                  ACM Digital Library and CNKI).ResultsThe predominant design in
                  AI‐driven assessment tools is the structural AI architecture.
                  These tools are most frequently deployed in classroom settings
                  for upper primary students within a short duration. A
                  subsequent meta‐analysis showed a medium overall effect size

                  moderator variables (i.e., assessment type, intervention
                  duration, educational level and L1/L2 learners) and potential
                  impacts on language learning performance indicates that
                  AI‐enabled assessment could be more useful in language
                  education with a proper implementation design. Future research
                  could investigate diverse instructional designs for

                  of teaching, learning and assessment processes. As a recent EU
                  Report underlines, the assessment and feedback area remains a
                  problematic issue regarding educational professionals training
                  and adopting new practices. In fact, traditional summative
                  assessment practices are predominantly used in European
                  countries, against the recommendations of the Bologna Process
                  guidelines that promote the implementation of alternative
                  assessment practices that seem crucial in order to engage and
                  provide lifelong learning skills for students, also with the
                  use of technology. Looking at the literature, a series of
                  sustainability problems arise when these requests meet
                  real-world teaching, particularly when academic instructors
                  face the assessment of extensive classes. With the fast
                  advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their
                  increasing availability, affordability and capability, part of
                  the solution to these problems might be at hand. In fact, LLMs
                  can process large amounts of text, summarise and give feedback
                  about it following predetermined criteria. The insights of
                  that analysis can be used both for giving feedback to the
                  student and helping the instructor assess the text. With the
                  proper pedagogical and technological framework, LLMs can
                  disengage instructors from some of the time-related
                  sustainability issues and so from the only choice of the
                  multiple-choice test and similar. For this reason, as a first
                  step, we are designing and validating a theoretical framework
                  and a teaching model for fostering the use of LLMs in
                  assessment practice, with the approaches that can be most
                  beneficial.},

                  potential impact of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                  such as ChatGPT on the Education field, but little examination
                  at scale of how educators believe teaching and assessment
                  should change as a result of generative AI. This mixed methods
                  study examines the views of educators (n = 318) from a diverse
                  range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas,
                  and regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment,
                  the ways that they believe teaching and assessment should
                  change, and the key motivations for changing their practices.
                  The majority of teachers felt that generative AI would have a
                  major or profound impact on teaching and assessment, though a
                  sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no impact.
                  Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and
                  gender all significantly influenced perceived impact of
                  generative AI on teaching and assessment. Higher levels of
                  awareness of generative AI predicted higher perceived impact,
                  pointing to the possibility of an ‘ignorance effect’. Thematic
                  analysis revealed the specific curriculum, pedagogy, and
                  assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a result
                  of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI,
                  higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning
                  processes and face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were
                  most motivated to change their teaching and assessment
                  practices to increase the performance expectancy of their
                  students and themselves. We conclude by discussing the

                  to enhance learning, teaching, and assessment by providing
                  AI-generated feedback to students. This study used five
                  different AI plug-ins and four different knowledge bases for
                  the optimization of feedback in classroom formative
                  assessments. The sample consisted of 26 students and 13
                  teachers at five secondary schools in Norway. Interviews and
                  unstructured observations were used to collect data. The
                  findings indicate that AI-generated feedback is appreciated by
                  both students and teachers. It provides immediate
                  subject-specific, concrete, and relevant feedback.
                  High-performing students were motivated to further improve
                  their writing. However, some students found the feedback to be
                  too general or complicated, and the teachers who had not
                  conducted whole-term periodic planning struggled with using AI
                  for formative assessment purposes. Finally, both students and
                  teachers contend that the teacher needs to have the last word
                  when AI takes over formative feedback procedures.},

                  of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically
                  ChatGPT and Google's Bard, in grading student essays in higher
                  education based on an analytical grading rubric. A total of 15
                  experienced English as a foreign language (EFL) instructors
                  and two LLMs were asked to evaluate three student essays of
                  varying quality. The grading scale comprised five domains:
                  grammar, content, organization, style \& expression and
                  mechanics. The results revealed that fine‐tuned ChatGPT model
                  demonstrated a very high level of reliability with an
                  intraclass correlation (ICC) score of 0.972, Default ChatGPT
                  model exhibited an ICC score of 0.947 and Bard showed a
                  substantial level of reliability with an ICC score of 0.919.
                  Additionally, a significant overlap was observed in certain
                  domains when comparing the grades assigned by LLMs and human
                  raters. In conclusion, the findings suggest that while LLMs
                  demonstrated a notable consistency and potential for grading
                  competency, further fine‐tuning and adjustment are needed for
                  a more nuanced understanding of non‐objective essay criteria.
                  The study not only offers insights into the potential use of
                  LLMs in grading student essays but also highlights the need
                  for continued development and research. Practitioner notesWhat
                  is already known about this topic Large language models
                  (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, are known
                  for their ability to generate text that mimics human‐like
                  conversation and writing. LLMs can perform various tasks,
                  including essay grading. Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a
                  statistical measure used to assess the reliability of ratings
                  given by different raters (in this case, EFL instructors and
                  LLMs). What this paper adds The study makes a unique
                  contribution by directly comparing the grading performance of
                  expert EFL instructors with two LLMs—ChatGPT and Bard—using an
                  analytical grading scale. It provides robust empirical
                  evidence showing high reliability of LLMs in grading essays,
                  supported by high ICC scores. It specifically highlights that
                  the overall efficacy of LLMs extends to certain domains of
                  essay grading. Implications for practice and/or policyThe
                  findings open up potential new avenues for utilizing LLMs in
                  academic settings, particularly for grading student essays,
                  thereby possibly alleviating workload of educators.The paper's
                  insistence on the need for further fine‐tuning of LLMs
                  underlines the continual interplay between technological
                  advancement and its practical applications.The results lay
                  down a footprint for future research in advancing the use of
                  AI in essay grading.},

                  models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the
                  laborious process of generating and analysing textual content.
                  While various innovations have been developed to automate a
                  range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback
                  provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding
                  the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such
                  concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of
                  LLMs‐based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To
                  address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118
                  peer‐reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the
                  current state of research on using LLMs to automate and
                  support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases
                  for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine
                  main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading,
                  teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation,
                  feedback, content generation, and recommendation.
                  Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical
                  challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of
                  replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and
                  beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into
                  three recommendations for future studies, including updating
                  existing innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models (eg,
                  GPT‐3/4), embracing the initiative of open‐sourcing
                  models/systems, and adopting a human‐centred approach
                  throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of
                  AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of
                  this study can serve as an essential reference point for
                  researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn
                  from the limitations, and uncover potential research
                  opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI
                  models. What is currently known about this topic Generating
                  and analysing text‐based content are time‐consuming and
                  laborious tasks. Large language models are capable of
                  efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual
                  content and completing complex natural language processing and
                  generation tasks. Large language models have been increasingly
                  used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate
                  the generation and analysis of textual content, such as
                  automated question generation and essay scoring. What this

                  that could potentially benefit from LLMs‐based innovations
                  through automation. A structured assessment of the
                  practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs‐based innovations
                  from seven important aspects using established frameworks.
                  Three recommendations that could potentially support future
                  studies to develop LLMs‐based innovations that are practical
                  and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts.
                  Implications for practice and/or policy Updating existing
                  innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models may further reduce
                  the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing
                  models to different educational tasks. The reporting standards
                  of empirical research that aims to develop educational
                  technologies using large language models need to be improved.
                  Adopting a human‐centred approach throughout the developmental
                  process could contribute to resolving the practical and
                  ethical challenges of large language models in education.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing
                  and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit
                  remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks,
                  challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The
                  latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an
                  unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we
                  report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when
                  it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that
                  (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs
                  (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that
                  exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We
                  discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these
                  models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language,
                  GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span
                  mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and
                  more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all
                  of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to
                  human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior
                  models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's
                  capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as
                  an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial
                  general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of
                  GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations,
                  and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards
                  deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the
                  possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond
                  next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal
                  influences of the recent technological leap and future
                  research directions.},

  abstract     = {Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language
                  modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve
                  performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this
                  capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading
                  to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to
                  achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.
                  First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired
                  with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate
                  through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second,
                  we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by
                  forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or
                  lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the
                  model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the
                  model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect
                  reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the
                  Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it
                  with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on
                  competition math questions by up to 27\% (MATH and AIME24).
                  Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows
                  extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time
                  intervention: from 50\% to 57\% on AIME24. Our model, data,

                  integrating AI into higher education settings. Several
                  articles included in this special issue explore these
                  opportunities and challenges from diverse viewpoints and
                  within various contexts, across countries such as Australia,
                  the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Cyprus, and GCC nations. Finally,
                  we propose several avenues for future research aimed at
                  enhancing student engagement through AI, charting a path
                  forward for empirical evidence and practical application of AI
                  and chatbots in enhancing student engagement.},

  abstract  = {DOI: 10.4324/9781003440178-16Integrating AI Literacy into Higher
               Education A Practical Framework Simone Kurtzke Introduction While
               artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly expanded into
               business and society in recent decades (Southworth et al., 2023),
               it is arguably the rapid awareness following the public release
               of ChatGPT in November 2022 that has brought the disruptiveness
               of AI to wider attention (Cardon et al., 2023). While the UK
               higher education (HE) sector’s initial focus has been on
               assessment redesign and academic integrity (Quality Assurance
               Agency for Higher Education, 2023), in the UK Russell Group’s
               principles on the use of generative AI (GAI) tools, the first
               prin- ciple is to “support students and staff to become AI
               literate” (Russell Group, 2023, p.1), while the second principle
               highlights the pressing need for tool training. Both principles
               contain practical, technical knowledge as a key objective. This
               chapter supports this goal by first defining AI literacy in the
               context of digital skills development for students. It then
               discusses a hands-on approach for integrating AI literacy at a
               business school through assessment redesign and experiential
               learning. The case study in question examined the design and
               implementa- tion of a specific learning activity designed to give
               marketing students first-hand experience with the application and
               use of GAI to foster practical skills, as well as critical and
               ethical understanding. Notably, the study focused on AI literacy
               in the discipline context of marketing as the aim was to engage
               students in the purposeful use of GAI to solve authentic problems
               and equip them with the right skills for employment. The author
               has existing digital and technology skills and as part of the
               study, undertook rapid upskilling in GAI through self-directed
               learning, a critical meta-competence in the 21st century (Morris
               \& Rohs, 2021). The presentation outlines the context of stu-
               dent digital skills, defines AI literacy, considers the
               pedagogical design of the intervention, and explains the
               resulting learning activity. It then discusses the initial
               outcomes via student results (grades) from the first assessment,
               as well as a poll conducted after 5 weeks of teaching. It ends by
               drawing out practical recommendations for educators wishing to
               integrate AI literacy and GAI in the context of their own
               practice. The conclusion highlights the strengths of the
               integrated, experiential approach, while acknowledging its
               limitation},

  abstract  = {The Socratic dialogue as a principle for knowledge formation and
               learning is discussed in depth. Dialogue is necessary when formal
               research techniques are no longer sufficient, and one needs to
               reflect upon what one does know and what needs to be done. This
               act of reflection is not just about the "production of
               information". What is gained from dialogue is "subjective" not
               "objective" knowledge: the knowledge is tied to the participants.
               Describing the dialogue is to describe a conception of human
               reason - a conception of "autonomous persons, striving on an
               equal basis to get rid of prejudices and illusions". Hence human
               reason is not primarily something inside people's heads. The
               dialogue shows a process of knowledge formation by example, not
               by theory. Dialogue is the opposite to theory. The chapter closes
               with an analysis of the meaning of error. In computer science and
               statistics the concept of error is one-dimensional. It focusSes
               on the misfit between theory, or model, and data. Errors are seen
               as being mainly technical. There is a lack of understanding about
               the concept of error in its many guises. For example, misunder-
               standings are important as they lead to greater understanding.
               Insecurity and uncertainty are" good" errors as they show that
               there is something to learn. There is no such thing as "pure
               knowledge". There are only people arguing and investigating, and
               so on.},

  abstract     = {Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and
                  new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite
                  their potentially transformative impact, these new
                  capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to
                  inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model
                  capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is
                  vital that we understand the present and near-future
                  capabilities and limitations of language models. To address
                  this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game
                  benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204
                  tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions.
                  Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics,
                  childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology,
                  physics, social bias, software development, and beyond.
                  BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the
                  capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the
                  behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense
                  transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse
                  transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning
                  millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a
                  team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to
                  provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance
                  and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in
                  absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance);
                  performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though
                  with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and
                  predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization
                  component, whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior
                  at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or
                  components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically
                  increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but
                  this can be improved with prompting.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have
                  entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in
                  interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this
                  intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept
                  LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable
                  we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which
                  they are embedded as more human-like than they really are.
                  This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use
                  philosophically loaded terms, such as "knows", "believes", and
                  "thinks", when describing these systems. To mitigate this
                  trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly
                  stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems
                  of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that
                  increased scientific precision will encourage more
                  philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial
                  intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.},

  abstract     = {The application of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED)
                  is experiencing widespread interest among students, educators,
                  researchers, and policymakers. AIED is expected, among other
                  things, to enhance learning environments in the higher
                  education system. However, in line with the general trends,
                  there are also increasing concerns about possible negative and
                  collateral effects. The consequent social impact cannot be
                  currently assessed in depth. Balancing benefits with social
                  considerations according to a socio-technical approach is
                  essential for harnessing the true power of AI in a responsible
                  and trustworthy context. This study proposes a semi-systematic
                  literature review of the available knowledge on the adoption
                  of artificial intelligence (AI) in the higher education
                  system. It presents a stakeholder-centric analysis to explore
                  multiple perspectives, including pedagogical, managerial,
                  technological, governmental, external, and social ones. The
                  main goal is to identify and discuss major gaps and challenges
                  in context, looking at the existing body of knowledge and
                  momentum. AIED should encompass pedagogical, ethical, and
                  social dimensions to be properly addressed. This review
                  highlights a not-always-explicit socio-technical perspective.
                  Additionally, this study reveals a significant lack of
                  empirical systematic evaluation of added value and
                  institutional readiness. Because of the broad scope of the
                  study and the intense ongoing debate on the topic, an
                  exhaustive identification of the current body of knowledge is
                  probably unrealistic, so this study aims mainly to identify
                  the mainstream and major trends by looking at the most recent
                  contributions.},

                  young students is gaining traction among researchers and
                  educators. Researchers are developing courses and attempting
                  to teach AI literacy to younger students, using
                  age‐appropriate AI educational learning tools. Although
                  teachers play a crucial role in AI literacy education, their
                  perceptions and attitudes have received little attention. This
                  study explores the perceptions of 60 teachers regarding the
                  use of AI educational learning tools, and examines the factors
                  influencing their attitudes in relation to implementing AI
                  literacy education. The technological acceptance model and the
                  technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (CK) (TPACK)
                  framework inform the research design, and a mixed method,
                  combining the statistical package for Social Science and
                  thematic analysis, is employed for data analysis. The study
                  reveals that teachers have positive perceptions regarding the
                  usefulness and ease of use of AI educational learning tools in
                  their AI literacy teaching. This paper also reveals that
                  teachers embrace an arts‐based approach to teaching AI
                  literacy. The qualitative data reveal that teachers face
                  challenges such as insufficient CK and experience with AI; and
                  knowledge of TPACK. The five factors affecting their
                  acceptance of AI educational learning tools are: (a) teachers'
                  perceptions of their AI CK and experience in teaching AI
                  literacy (technological content knowledge); (b) technical
                  challenges and stakeholder acceptance; (c) the attributes of
                  AI educational learning tools; (d) school infrastructure and
                  budget constraints; and (e) potential for distraction and
                  negative emotional responses. This study offers insights for
                  policymakers regarding professional development initiatives
                  and technical support mechanisms, thereby facilitating more
                  effective AI literacy implementation.},

  abstract     = {Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research
                  effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and
                  attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data
                  into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention
                  allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the
                  direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling
                  of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost,
                  limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new
                  neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize
                  historical context and helps attention to attend to the
                  current context while utilizing long past information. We show
                  that this neural memory has the advantage of fast
                  parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference.
                  From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its
                  limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a
                  short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to
                  memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent,
                  memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family
                  of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to
                  address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this
                  architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling,
                  common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show
                  that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent
                  modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively
                  scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher
                  accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.},

  abstract     = {Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the
                  challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are
                  often computationally intensive and static in their ability to
                  handle diverse tasks. We introduce $\text{Transformer}^2$, a
                  novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen
                  tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular
                  components of their weight matrices. During inference,
                  $\text{Transformer}^2$ employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a
                  dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then
                  task-specific "expert" vectors, trained using reinforcement
                  learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior
                  for the incoming prompt. Our method outperforms ubiquitous
                  approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater
                  efficiency. $\text{Transformer}^2$ demonstrates versatility
                  across different LLM architectures and modalities, including
                  vision-language tasks. $\text{Transformer}^2$ represents a
                  significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient
                  solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific
                  performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic,
                  self-organizing AI systems.},

                  of Relational Frame Theory. More specifically, even if all

                  across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental
                  challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current
                  reinforcement learning algorithms can be readily applied to
                  tasks similar to what they have been developed for,
                  configuring them for new application domains requires
                  significant human expertise and experimentation. We present
                  DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized
                  methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single
                  configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and
                  improves its behavior by imagining future scenarios.
                  Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing, and
                  transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied
                  out of the box, Dreamer is the first algorithm to collect
                  diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or
                  curricula. This achievement has been posed as a significant
                  challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring
                  farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an
                  open world. Our work allows solving challenging control
                  problems without extensive experimentation, making

                  cognitive ability and educational outcomes. Most studies to
                  date have been under-powered and included proxy measures of
                  educational attainment. We attempted to extend previous
                  findings with increased experimental control in younger
                  children (aged 6.9–10.1 years). Participants (N = 49) were
                  assigned to either a relational training or chess control
                  group. Over 5 months, teachers assigned class time to complete
                  either relational training or play chess. Those who were
                  assigned relational training gained 8.9 non-verbal IQ (NVIQ)
                  points, while those in the control condition recorded no gains
                  (dppc2 = .99). Regression analyses revealed that post-training
                  NVIQ predicted reading test scores (conducted approximately 1
                  month later) over and above baseline NVIQ in the experimental

                  over several months to an intensive training intervention to
                  improve their understanding of the relations Same, Opposite

  abstract     = {AbstractWhile Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED)
                  research has at its core the desire to support student
                  learning, experience from other AI domains suggest that such
                  ethical intentions are not by themselves sufficient. There is
                  also the need to consider explicitly issues such as fairness,
                  accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and
                  inclusion. At a more general level, there is also a need to
                  differentiate between doing ethical things and doing things
                  ethically, to understand and to make pedagogical choices that
                  are ethical, and to account for the ever-present possibility
                  of unintended consequences. However, addressing these and
                  related questions is far from trivial. As a first step towards
                  addressing this critical gap, we invited 60 of the AIED
                  community’s leading researchers to respond to a survey of
                  questions about ethics and the application of AI in
                  educational contexts. In this paper, we first introduce issues
                  around the ethics of AI in education. Next, we summarise the
                  contributions of the 17 respondents, and discuss the complex
                  issues that they raised. Specific outcomes include the
                  recognition that most AIED researchers are not trained to
                  tackle the emerging ethical questions. A well-designed
                  framework for engaging with ethics of AIED that combined a
                  multidisciplinary approach and a set of robust guidelines
                  seems vital in this context.},

                  compelling motivation for early AI education and cover an
                  impressive range of approaches, grade levels, and
                  perspectives. Despite the differences, there is coherence
                  across the articles in terms of the goals to address AI
                  awareness, knowledge, skills, and ethics. Deep consideration
                  has gone into creating developmentally appropriate AI content,
                  which is arguably the greatest challenge for a complex topic
                  like AI. However, as we find in many emerging topics in
                  education, the demand for curricula and lessons has outpaced
                  the capacity of the field to do sufficient empirical research
                  on how kids learn about AI. Evidence for many of the design
                  choices reflected in the proposals put forth in this special
                  issue is still emerging. The authors have done an admirable
                  job of organizing their ideas around principles from the
                  learning sciences and connecting their efforts to more general
                  curriculum design efforts, such as the K12 CS Framework
                  (2016). The next step, which is promoted by all of the authors
                  in the special issue, is to define a research agenda to
                  provide an empirical basis for the design of early AI learning
                  experiences and inform future iterations of the curricula and
                  frameworks proposed.},

                  System (NARS) Theory as an approach to build intelligent
                  systems with agency is given. This contains the requirement to
                  work under the Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and
                  Resources which demands open-ended adaptation while obeying to
                  strict computational resource restrictions to allow for
                  real-time response. We show how this aligns with the
                  phenomenon of intelligence as found in nature, allowing for
                  systems which can both react instantly, and plan ahead
                  deliberately dependent on implicitly outcome-dependent time

                  see that both techniques perform comparably well for reactive

                  reasoner performs better when the Markov property is violated,
                  with the additional property that it can plan ahead to exploit

  abstract     = {This paper presents an interdisciplinary framework, Machine
                  Psychology, which integrates principles from operant learning
                  psychology with a particular Artificial Intelligence model,
                  the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), to advance
                  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. Central to
                  this framework is the assumption that adaptation is
                  fundamental to both biological and artificial intelligence,
                  and can be understood using operant conditioning principles.
                  The study evaluates this approach through three operant
                  learning tasks using OpenNARS for Applications (ONA): simple
                  discrimination, changing contingencies, and conditional
                  discrimination tasks. In the simple discrimination task, NARS
                  demonstrated rapid learning, achieving 100\% correct responses
                  during training and testing phases. The changing contingencies
                  task illustrated NARS's adaptability, as it successfully
                  adjusted its behavior when task conditions were reversed. In
                  the conditional discrimination task, NARS managed complex
                  learning scenarios, achieving high accuracy by forming and
                  utilizing complex hypotheses based on conditional cues. These
                  results validate the use of operant conditioning as a
                  framework for developing adaptive AGI systems. NARS's ability
                  to function under conditions of insufficient knowledge and
                  resources, combined with its sensorimotor reasoning
                  capabilities, positions it as a robust model for AGI. The
                  Machine Psychology framework, by implementing aspects of
                  natural intelligence such as continuous learning and
                  goal-driven behavior, provides a scalable and flexible
                  approach for real-world applications. Future research should
                  explore using enhanced NARS systems, more advanced tasks and
                  applying this framework to diverse, complex tasks to further
                  advance the development of human-level AI.},

                  Functional equivalence allows organisms to categorize and
                  respond to varied stimuli based on their utility rather than
                  perceptual similarity, thus enhancing cognitive efficiency and
                  adaptability. In this study, ONA was modified to allow the
                  derivation of functional equivalence. This paper provides
                  practical examples of the capability of ONA to apply learned
                  knowledge across different functional situations,
                  demonstrating its utility in complex problem-solving and
                  decision-making. An extended example is included, where
                  training of ONA aimed to learn basic human-like language
                  abilities, using a systematic procedure in relating spoken
                  words, objects and written words. The research carried out as
                  part of this study extends the understanding of functional
                  equivalence in AGI systems, and argues for its necessity for
                  level of flexibility in learning and adapting necessary for
                  human-level AGI.},

  abstract     = {This article describes and discusses the self-related
                  mechanisms of a general-purpose intelligent system, NARS. This
                  system is designed to be adaptive and to work with
                  insufficient knowledge and resources. The system's various
                  cognitive functions are uniformly carried out by a central
                  reasoning-learning process following a "non-axiomatic" logic.
                  This logic captures the regularities of human empirical
                  reasoning, where all beliefs are revisable according to
                  evidence, and the meaning of concepts are grounded in the
                  system's experience. NARS perceives its internal environment
                  basically in the same way as how it perceives its external
                  environment although the sensors involved are completely
                  different. Consequently, its self-knowledge is mostly acquired
                  and constructive, while being incomplete and subjective.
                  Similarly, self-control in NARS is realized using mental
                  operations, which supplement and adjust the automatic
                  inference control routine. It is argued that a general-purpose
                  intelligent system needs the notion of a "self," and the
                  related knowledge and functions are developed gradually
                  according to the system's experience. Such a mechanism has
                  been implemented in NARS in a preliminary form.},

  abstract     = {Abstract According to various international reports,
                  Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the
                  currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it
                  has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for
                  educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader
                  scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching
                  and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide
                  an overview of research on AI applications in higher education
                  through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified
                  publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146
                  articles were included for final synthesis, according to
                  explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive
                  results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd
                  papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that
                  quantitative methods were the most frequently used in
                  empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four
                  areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and
                  institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and
                  prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems
                  and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The
                  conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection
                  of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to
                  theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further
                  exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the
                  application of AIEd in higher education.},

                  this study, we examine the emerging research area of AI
                  chatbots in higher education (HE), focusing specifically on
                  empirical studies conducted since the release of ChatGPT. Our
                  review includes 23 research articles published between
                  December 2022 and December 2023 exploring the use of AI
                  chatbots in HE settings. We take a three-pronged approach to
                  the empirical data. We first examine the state of the emerging
                  field of AI chatbots in HE. Second, we identify the theories
                  of learning used in the empirical studies on AI chatbots in
                  HE. Third, we scrutinise the discourses of AI in HE framing
                  the latest empirical work on AI chatbots. Our findings
                  contribute to a better understanding of the eclectic state of
                  the nascent research area of AI chatbots in HE, the lack of

                  society with computers now capable of making process decisions
                  in many spheres of human activity. In education, there has
                  been intensive growth in systems that make formal and informal
                  learning an anytime, anywhere activity for billions of people
                  through online open educational resources and massive online
                  open courses. Moreover, new developments in Artificial
                  Intelligence‐related educational assessment are attracting
                  increasing interest as means of improving assessment efficacy
                  and validity, with much attention focusing on the analysis of
                  the large volumes of process data being captured from digital
                  assessment contexts. In evaluating the state of play of
                  Artificial Intelligence in formative and summative educational
                  assessment, this paper offers a critical perspective on the
                  two core applications: automated essay scoring systems and
                  computerized adaptive tests, along with the Big Data analysis
                  approaches to machine learning that underpin them.},

                  application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have
                  yielded a far-reaching discourse on AI ethics. In consequence,
                  a number of ethics guidelines have been released in recent
                  years. These guidelines comprise normative principles and
                  recommendations aimed to harness the “disruptive” potentials
                  of new AI technologies. Designed as a semi-systematic
                  evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines,
                  highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give
                  a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics. Finally, I also
                  examine to what extent the respective ethical principles and
                  values are implemented in the practice of research,
                  development and application of AI systems—and how the
                  effectiveness in the demands of AI ethics can be improved.},

                  is on the duty to act and LA as a moral practice. Data

                  establishes four criteria of a good working definition of a
                  notion: being similar to its common usage, drawing a sharp
                  boundary, leading to fruitful research, and as simple as
                  possible. According to these criteria, the representative
                  definitions in the field are analyzed. A new definition is
                  proposed, according to it intelligence means “adaptation with
                  insufficient knowledge and resources.” The implications of
                  this definition are discussed, and it is compared with the
                  other definitions. It is claimed that this definition sheds
                  light on the solution of many existing problems and sets a

  abstract     = {AbstractSince the publication of their inaugural paper on the
                  topic in 2006, Braun and Clarke’s approach has arguably become
                  one of the most thoroughly delineated methods of conducting
                  thematic analysis (TA). However, confusion persists as to how
                  to implement this specific approach to TA appropriately. The
                  authors themselves have identified that many researchers who
                  purport to adhere to this approach—and who reference their
                  work as such—fail to adhere fully to the principles of
                  ‘reflexive thematic analysis’ (RTA). Over the course of
                  numerous publications, Braun and Clarke have elaborated
                  significantly upon the constitution of RTA and attempted to
                  clarify numerous misconceptions that they have found in the
                  literature. This paper will offer a worked example of Braun
                  and Clarke’s contemporary approach to reflexive thematic
                  analysis with the aim of helping to dispel some of the
                  confusion regarding the position of RTA among the numerous
                  existing typologies of TA. While the data used in the worked
                  example has been garnered from health and wellbeing education
                  research and was examined to ascertain educators’ attitudes
                  regarding such, the example offered of how to implement the
                  RTA would be easily transferable to many other contexts and
                  research topics.},

                  Midjourney) and human individuals performing equivalent

                  or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and

                  those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a
                  more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential

  abstract     = {AbstractAlthough the field of Artificial Intelligence in
                  Education (AIEd) has a substantial history as a research
                  domain, never before has the rapid evolution of AI
                  applications in education sparked such prominent public
                  discourse. Given the already rapidly growing AIEd literature
                  base in higher education, now is the time to ensure that the
                  field has a solid research and conceptual grounding. This
                  review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to
                  explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education
                  (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g.,
                  systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus,
                  ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital
                  Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex,
                  ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they
                  synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or
                  continuing education, were published in English between 2018
                  and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference
                  papers, and if they had a method section 66 publications were
                  included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer,
                  which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7\%),
                  published by authors from North America (27.3\%), conducted in
                  teams (89.4\%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations
                  (71.2\%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on
                  AIHEd generally (47.0\%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8\%)
                  as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a
                  predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and
                  Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified
                  suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and
                  contextual considerations within future research, alongside
                  interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions
                  are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.},

                  learning environment, as well as to seek greater understanding
                  of why human tutoring is so effective. This alternative
                  learning environment consists of pairs of students
                  collaboratively observing a videotape of another student being
                  tutored. Comparing this collaboratively observing environment
                  to four other instructional methods-one-on-one human tutoring,
                  observing tutoring individually, collaborating without
                  observing, and studying alone-the results showed that students
                  learned to solve physics problems just as effectively from
                  observing tutoring collaboratively as the tutees who were
                  being tutored individually. We explain the effectiveness of
                  this learning environment by postulating that such a situation
                  encourages learners to become active and constructive
                  observers through interactions with a peer. In essence,
                  collaboratively observing combines the benefit of tutoring
                  with the benefit of collaborating. The learning outcomes of
                  the tutees and the collaborative observers, along with the
                  tutoring dialogues, were used to further evaluate three
                  hypotheses explaining why human tutoring is an effective
                  learning method. Detailed analyses of the protocols at several
                  grain sizes suggest that tutoring is effective when tutees are
                  independently or jointly constructing knowledge: with the
                  tutor, but not when the tutor independently conveys knowledge.},

  abstract     = {This article reviews the 10-year history of tutor development
                  based on the advanced computer tutoring (ACT) theory (J. R.
                  Anderson, 1983, 1993). We developed production system models
                  in ACT of how students solved problems in LISP, geometry, and
                  algebra. Computer tutors were developed around these cognitive
                  models. Construction of these tutors was guided by a set of
                  eight principles loosely based on the ACT theory. Early
                  evaluations of these tutors usually, but not always, showed
                  significant achievement gains. Best case evaluations showed
                  that students could achieve at least the same level of
                  proficiency as conventional instruction in one third of the
                  time. Empirical studies showed that students were learning
                  skills in production-rule units and that the best tutorial
                  interaction style was one in which the tutor provides
                  immediate feedback, consisting of short and directed error
                  messages. The tutors appear to work better if they present
                  themselves to students as nonhuman tools to assist learning
                  rather than as emulations of human tutors. Students working
                  with these tutors display transfer to other environments to
                  the degree that they can map the tutor environment into the
                  test environment. These experiences have coalesced into a new
                  system for developing and deploying tutors. This system
                  involves selecting a problem-solving interface, constructing a
                  curriculum under the guidance of a domain expert, designing a
                  cognitive model for solving problems in that environment,
                  building instruction around the productions in that model, and
                  deploying the tutor in the classroom. New tutors are being
                  built in this system to achieve the National Council of
                  Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards for high-school
                  mathematics in an urban setting.},

                  learning (CBAfL), in elementary and secondary education, as a
                  viable way to merge instruction and assessment of students'
                  developing proficiencies. We begin by contextualizing our
                  topic relative to summative and formative assessment before
                  presenting the current literature, which we categorized into
                  the following: (a) supplementary use in classrooms, (b)
                  web-based, and (c) data-driven, continuous CBAfL. Examples of
                  research studies per category are provided. Findings show that
                  using CBAfL in the classroom, via the Internet, or embedded in
                  a game, generally enhances learning and other outcomes across
                  a range of content areas (e.g. biology, math, and
                  programming). One conclusion is that feedback, to be most
                  beneficial to learning, should not be overly complex and must
                  be used to be effective. Findings also showed that the quality
                  of the assessment (i.e. validity, reliability, and efficiency)
                  is unimpaired by the inclusion of feedback. The possibilities
                  created by advances in the learning sciences, measurement, and
                  technology have paved the way toward new assessment approaches
                  that will support personalized learning and that can
                  accurately measure and support complex competencies. The next
                  steps involve evaluating the new assessments regarding their
                  psychometric properties and support of learning. Lay
                  Description What is currently known about computer-based
                  assessment for learning (CBAfL)? Early CBAfL systems were
                  divided into linear and branching programs with no diagnostics
                  and evolved into systems possessing more personalized/adaptive
                  remediation with AI. Current CBAfL can support a range of
                  competencies in various digital environments. Advanced
                  learning analytic methods include learning analytics and
                  stealth assessment. What our paper adds to what is already
                  known about CBA for learning? Trends in our review suggest
                  CBAs will improve in personalizing learning in a variety of
                  contexts. Innovative CBAfL techniques will move beyond the
                  laboratory and into the mainstream. Boundaries between
                  instruction, learning and assessment will eventually become
                  blurred, thus removing the need for high-stake tests of
                  learning. What are the implications of our topic for
                  practitioners? With CBAfL advances, teachers will have more
                  time to provide targeted support to learners. Students would
                  not need to worry about taking exams if CBAfL is continuous
                  and formative. Educators will be able to provide personalized
                  learning experiences for diverse students. Students will be
                  equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in

                  futures in light of these advancements. The goal of this study
                  is to analyse the usage patterns and future value perceptions
                  of ChatGPT among 70 high school students through a
                  survey-based approach. A key finding highlights that
                  technology has become an integral element of contemporary
                  life, underscoring the historical relevance of Natural
                  Language Processing (NLP) and the eagerness of the younger
                  generation to adopt such emerging technologies. High school
                  students utilise ChatGPT for various purposes, including
                  academic support, social communication, and personal
                  management, across both educational and social contexts.
                  Moreover, the participants conveyed a positive outlook on the
                  potential of ChatGPT to significantly impact their lives in
                  the coming years while acknowledging possible hurdles. Based
                  on the findings of this study, it is clear that NLP tools like
                  ChatGPT have a crucial role in moulding the experiences and
                  anticipations of high school students. This paper, therefore,

                  the sample text and codebook into an LLM. We asked the LLM to
                  determine if the codes were present in a sample text provided
                  and requested evidence to support the coding. The sample texts
                  were inputted 160 times to record changes between iterations

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful
                  generative Artificial Intelligence solutions. This paper
                  presents results and reflections of an experiment done with
                  the LLM GPT 3.5-Turbo to perform an inductive Thematic
                  Analysis (TA). Previous research has worked on conducting
                  deductive analysis. Thematic Analysis is a qualitative method
                  for analysis commonly used in social sciences and it is based
                  on interpretations by the human analyst(s) and the
                  identification of explicit and latent meanings in qualitative
                  data. The paper presents the motivations for attempting this
                  analysis; it reflects on how the six phases to a TA proposed
                  by Braun and Clarke can partially be reproduced with the LLM
                  and it reflects on what are the model’s outputs. The paper
                  uses two datasets of open access semi-structured interviews,
                  previously analysed by other researchers. The first dataset
                  contains interviews with videogame players, and the second is
                  a dataset of interviews with lecturers teaching data science
                  in a University. This paper used the analyses previously
                  conducted on these datasets to compare with the results
                  produced by the LLM. The results show that the model can infer
                  most of the main themes from previous research. This shows
                  that using LLMs to perform an inductive TA is viable and
                  offers a good degree of validity. The discussion offers some
                  recommendations for working with LLMs in qualitative analysis.},

                  accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if done
                  manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models
                  have made it a realistic option for individuals. This study
                  explores and evaluates a combination of clustering,
                  summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze over 1,000
                  student essays in which students discussed their career
                  interests. The specific assignment prompted students to define
                  and explain their career goals as engineers. Using text
                  embedding representations of student responses, we clustered
                  the responses together to identify thematically similar
                  statements from students. The clustered responses were then
                  summarized to quickly identify career interest themes. We also
                  used a set of a priori codes about career satisfaction and
                  sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these
                  generative text models to analyze student writing. The results
                  of this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of
                  NLP techniques in engineering education research. By
                  automating the initial analysis of student essays, researchers
                  and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key
                  themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented
                  in this paper have broader applications for engineering
                  education and research purposes beyond analyzing student
                  essays. By explaining these methods to the engineering
                  education community, readers can utilize them in their own

  abstract     = {Thematic analysis is a highly popular technique among
                  qualitative researchers for analyzing qualitative data, which
                  usually comprises thick descriptive data. However, the
                  application and use of thematic analysis has also involved
                  complications due to confusion regarding the final outcome’s
                  presentation as a conceptual model. This paper develops a
                  systematic thematic analysis process for creating a conceptual
                  model from qualitative research findings. It explores the
                  adaptability of the proposed process across various research
                  methodologies, including constructivist methodologies,
                  positivist methodologies, grounded theory, and interpretive
                  phenomenology, and justifies their application. The paper
                  distinguishes between inductive and deductive coding
                  approaches and emphasizes the merits of each. It suggests that
                  the derived systematic thematic analysis model is valuable
                  across multiple disciplines, particularly in grounded theory,
                  ethnographic approaches, and narrative approaches, while also
                  being adaptable to more descriptive, positivist-based
                  methodologies. By providing a methodological roadmap, this
                  study enhances the rigor and replicability of thematic
                  analysis and offers a comprehensive strategy for theoretical
                  conceptualization in qualitative research. The contribution of
                  this paper is a systematic six-step thematic analysis process
                  that leads to the development of a conceptual model; each step
                  is described in detail and examples are given.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, several issues regarding the epistemology of
                  technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) are first
                  raised for the purpose of clarifying the construct.
                  Specifically, the transformative and integrative views are
                  juxtaposed for exploring the epistemology of TPCK, and, at the
                  end, the transformative view is adopted concluding that TPCK
                  is a unique body of knowledge that is constructed from the
                  interaction of its individual contributing knowledge bases.
                  Then, ICT–TPCK is introduced as a strand of TPCK, and is
                  described as the ways knowledge about tools and their
                  affordances, pedagogy, content, learners, and context are
                  synthesized into an understanding of how particular topics
                  that are difficult to be understood by learners or difficult
                  to be represented by teachers can be transformed and taught
                  more effectively with technology in ways that signify its
                  added value. One model for the development and another for the
                  assessment of ICT–TPCK are then discussed. Technology Mapping
                  is proposed as a situative methodology for the development of
                  ICT–TPCK, and three forms of assessment, namely, expert
                  assessment, peer assessment, and self-assessment are proposed
                  for assessing teachers’ competencies to teach with technology.
                  The paper also reports on the empirical findings of a study
                  that was undertaken to investigate the impact of the proposed
                  models on student learning within the context of two design
                  tasks in a pre-service primary teacher education course.
                  Repeated measures within-subject effects were tested and the
                  results indicated that ICT–TPCK competency significantly
                  improved over the course of a semester. The results of this
                  study clearly show that the theoretical models proposed herein
                  can positively impact the development of ICT–TPCK. Lastly,
                  these results can be used as baseline data in future studies
                  that may be conducted to further validate or improve the
                  proposed models in different contexts.},

  abstract     = {In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that
                  automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the
                  decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for
                  labor—as it is typically intended to do. However, automation
                  also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to
                  higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in
                  labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to
                  overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor
                  and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and
                  labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment
                  demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of
                  jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few
                  decades, one noticeable change has been a “polarization” of
                  the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately
                  to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill
                  distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also
                  argue, this polarization and is unlikely to continue very far
                  into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how
                  recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and
                  robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory
                  of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the
                  interplay between machine and human comparative advantage
                  allows computers to substitute for workers in performing
                  routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative
                  advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills,
                  adaptability, and creativity.},

                  have generated great expectations for the future impact of AI
                  in education and learning (AIED). Often these expectations
                  have been based on misunderstanding current technical

  abstract     = {A major challenge facing the world is the provision of
                  equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent
                  advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement
                  about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal
                  tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every
                  teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet
                  materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the
                  difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen
                  AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices,
                  reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy.
                  Here we present our work collaborating with learners and
                  educators to translate high level principles from learning
                  science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational
                  benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and
                  human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning
                  datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini,
                  introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that
                  LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned
                  Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical
                  dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step
                  towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation
                  framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the
                  AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive
                  impact of gen AI in education.},

              professional career as a faculty member in Computer Science and
              Cognitive Science. For the last three decades, our research in the
              Center for Lifelong Learning \& Design (L3D) has been centered on
              human-centered design, intelligence augmentation, and distributed
              cognition with a focus how to transcend the unaided individual
              human mind with socio-technical environments [Arias et al., 2016;
              Arias et al., 2001]. The theme of this workshop “AI for Humans or
              Humans for AI” does not have a simple answer [Markoff, 2016]. My
              arguments are firmly grounded in “AI for Humans”. Our research
              activities and my contributions to previous CoPDA workshops
              explored problems more beneficial to the needs of people,
              societies, and humanity by postulating “Quality of Life” as an
              overarching design objective [Fischer, 2018], enriching the

  abstract     = {PurposeThe main argument behind this paper is learning in the
                  digital age should not be restricted to creating digital
                  infrastructures for supporting current forms of learning nor
                  taking schools in their current form as God-given, natural
                  entities, but changing current forms of education by
                  developing new frameworks and socio-technical environments for
                  making learning an integral part of life. The authors provide
                  a framework for this argumentation as well as a call-to-action
                  for research on the co-evolution of learning, media, and
                  learning organizations.Design/methodology/approachThis paper
                  theoretically and argumentatively explores the core assumption
                  that the digitalization of society results in challenges and
                  opportunities for learning and education based on fundamental
                  transformations (Collins and Halverson, 2009; Fischer et al.,
                  2020).FindingsThe digital age greatly enhances the
                  opportunities and supports the necessity for “making learning
                  a part of life”. But while the growth of technology is
                  certain, the inevitability of any particular future is not.
                  The impact of schooling goes beyond that new information about
                  computers, the Internet, and social media are integrated into
                  the schools of today. The transformation of schools needs to
                  be informed by an understanding of the impact of mindset
                  formation that will determine people's approach to learning
                  for the rest of their lives. The authors’ framework is focused
                  on moving “beyond gift-wrapping” by not only fixing and
                  existing systems but to change them and not only reforming but
                  transforming them.Originality/valueIt is the authors’ hope
                  that this article will be of interest to many stakeholders
                  (including learners, teachers, curriculum designers,
                  technology experts, parents, and politicians) and provide a
                  foundation for an ongoing debate and informed actions for
                  “Making Learning a Part of Life” in the digital age.},

                  Possible substitutes for leadership are reviewed along with a
                  number of existing dualisms. These are rejected in favour of
                  the claim that the leadership of organizations is most
                  appropriately understood as a distributed, rather thanas a
                  focused, phenomenon. Various attributes, dimensions and
                  applications of distribution are then considered, and a
                  revised approach to action and influence in organizations
                  centred on conjointly performed activities is thenproposed.
                  For this new formulation a summary is provided of the core
                  concepts of, and recent developments in, activity theory. It
                  is shown that two particular advantages of this approach

                  analysis—an aspect sorely neglected by the field of
                  leadership—and its focus on the evolving division of labour in
                  organizations, the prime mover for tracking emerging patterns

                  reform, where especially skilled teachers get an opportunity
                  to advance in their careers, is examined. The scene is an
                  upper secondary school, Baxter High, in the southwest of
                  Sweden. In this particular school, a new system with first
                  teachers replaces an old system of so-called head teachers.
                  The teachers’ response to this is multilayered: at the same
                  time as it reveals an unwillingness to change everyday work
                  rhythms, it is also a response to cultural change, and to
                  change in the discourse of political life in Baxter High. The
                  implementation of the first teacher reform results not only in
                  a change in administrative categories, but also in a change in
                  ideology, intertwined with and embedded in the cultural and
                  social life of the school. In this article, the authors
                  connect the first teacher reform to the neoliberal
                  transformation process that the Swedish educational system has

                  against a particular metaphor nor tries to make a case for the
                  other. Rather, these interpretations and applications of the
                  metaphors undergo critical evaluation. In the end, the
                  question of theoretical unification of the research on
                  learning is addressed, wherein the purpose is to show how too
                  great a devotion to one particular metaphor can lead to
                  theoretical distortions and to undesirable practices.},

                  summative assessments help students become deep learners and
                  prepare them to understand concepts for a subsequent
                  conceptual assessment. However, grading text-based questions,
                  especially in large (>50 enrolled students) courses, is
                  tedious and time-consuming for instructors. Text processing
                  models continue progressing with the rapid development of
                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Natural Language
                  Processing (NLP) algorithms. Especially after breakthroughs in
                  Large Language Models (LLM), there is immense potential to
                  automate rapid assessment and feedback of text-based responses
                  in education. This systematic review adopts a scientific and
                  reproducible literature search strategy based on the PRISMA
                  process using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to
                  study text-based automatic assessment systems in
                  post-secondary education, screening 838 papers and
                  synthesizing 93 studies. To understand how text-based
                  automatic assessment systems have been developed and applied
                  in education in recent years, three research questions are
                  considered: 1) What types of automated assessment systems can
                  be identified using input, output, and processing framework?
                  2) What are the educational focus and research motivations of
                  studies with automated assessment systems? 3) What are the
                  reported research outcomes in automated assessment systems and
                  the next steps for educational applications? All included
                  studies are summarized and categorized according to a proposed
                  comprehensive framework, including the input and output of the
                  system, research motivation, and research outcomes, aiming to
                  answer the research questions accordingly. Additionally, the
                  typical studies of automated assessment systems, research
                  methods, and application domains in these studies are

  abstract     = {With the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the
                  increasing volume of online educational data, Deep Learning
                  techniques have played a critical role in predicting student
                  performance. Recent developments have assisted instructors in
                  determining the strengths and weaknesses of student
                  achievement. This understanding will benefit from adopting the
                  necessary interventions to assist students in improving their
                  performance, helping at-risk of failure students, and
                  preventing dropout rates. The review analyzed 46 studies
                  between 2019 and 2023 that apply one or more Deep Learning
                  (DL) techniques, either single or in combination with Machine
                  Learning (ML) or Ensemble Learning techniques. Moreover, the
                  review utilized datasets from public Massive Open Online
                  Courses (MOOCs), private Learning Management Systems (LMSs),
                  and other platforms. Four categories were used to group the
                  features: demographic, previous academic performance, current
                  academic performance, and learning behavior/activity features.
                  The analysis revealed that the DNNs and CNN-LSTM models were
                  the most common techniques. Moreover, the studies that used DL
                  techniques, such as CNNs, DNNs, and LSTMs, performed well by
                  achieving high prediction accuracy above 90\%; other studies
                  achieved accuracy ranging (60 to 90)\%. For datasets used
                  within the reviewed studies, even though 44\% of the studies
                  used LMSs datasets, Open University Learning Analytics Dataset
                  (OULAD) was the most used dataset from MOOCs. The analysis of
                  grouped features shows that among the various categories
                  examined, learning behavior and activity features stand out as
                  the most significant predictors, suggesting that students
                  engagement with their learning environment through their
                  overall participation offers crucial insights into their
                  success. The educational prediction findings hopefully serve
                  as a strong foundation for administrators and instructors to
                  observe student performance and provide a suitable educational
                  adaptation that can meet their needs to protect them from
                  failure and prevent their dropout.},

                  influenced by a complex interplay among several factors.
                  Traditional educational approaches often struggle to
                  accommodate the diverse needs of students, leading to
                  suboptimal learning outcomes. Purpose This article aims to
                  comprehensively understand the role of study strategies and
                  learning disabilities in shaping academic performance. Through
                  the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the
                  purpose is to propose a decision support system (DSS) for
                  recommendations to improve the educational approach. Method To
                  identify features with higher explanatory power based on
                  empirical data, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN)
                  to recognize patterns of association between study strategies,
                  learning disabilities, and academic performance. Using the
                  pondered features, a Fuzzy-based AI was built for offering
                  recommendations into effective educational interventions.
                  Conclusions The findings underscore the significance of study
                  strategies in mitigating the negative impact of learning
                  disabilities on academic performance. By leveraging the
                  proposed AI tools framework, educators can make informed
                  decisions to tailor educational approaches, catering to the
                  unique cognitive profiles of students. Personalized
                  interventions based on identified patterns can lead to
                  improved academic outcomes and greater inclusivity in the
                  learning environment. Practical implications Educators and
                  policymakers can adopt the proposed data-driven strategies to
                  enhance teaching methodologies, thereby accommodating the
                  varying needs of students with learning disabilities. This

  abstract     = {Writing proficiency is an essential skill for upper secondary
                  students that can be enhanced through effective feedback.
                  Creating feedback on writing tasks, however, is time-intensive
                  and presents a challenge for educators, often resulting in
                  students receiving insufficient or no feedback. The advent of
                  text-generating large language models (LLMs) offers a
                  promising solution, namely, automated evidence-based feedback
                  generation. Yet, empirical evidence from randomized controlled
                  studies about the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback is
                  missing. To address this issue, the current study compared the
                  effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback to no feedback. A
                  sample of N = 459 upper secondary students of English as a
                  foreign language wrote an argumentative essay. Students in the
                  experimental group were asked to revise their text according
                  to feedback that was generated using the LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.
                  The control group revised their essays without receiving
                  feedback. We assessed improvement in the revision using
                  automated essay scoring. The results showed that LLM-generated
                  feedback increased revision performance (d = .19) and task
                  motivation (d = 0.36). Moreover, it increased positive
                  emotions (d = 0.34) compared to revising without feedback. The
                  findings highlight that using LLMs allows to create timely
                  feedback that can positively relate to students’ cognitive and
                  affective-motivational outcomes. Future perspectives and the
                  implications for research and practice of using LLM-generated
                  feedback in intelligent tutoring systems are discussed.},

                  and skills related to the fundamental ideas in AI. As AI
                  becomes increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, schools and
                  educators have started to recognize the importance of AI
                  education in K-12 schools. However, there have been a limited
                  number of studies reporting on the implementation of AI
                  education in classrooms. This systematic review aimed to
                  provide an overview of the current state of AI education in
                  K-12 schools, exploring topics, instructional approaches, and
                  learning outcomes. Twenty-five peer-reviewed journal articles
                  published between 2018 and 2023 were selected for this
                  systematic review. The findings highlighted that various
                  topics were covered in K-12 AI education, including
                  fundamental AI concepts, different types of AI, AI
                  applications, and ethical considerations related to AI. To
                  facilitate meaningful learning experiences, educators
                  frequently integrated hands-on activities and project-based
                  learning. The findings supported the benefits of AI education
                  in enhancing students' AI literacy, problem-solving skills,
                  and ethical reflections on AI's societal impact. Furthermore,
                  it fostered motivation, positive attitudes toward AI, and an
                  interest in technology while inspiring career aspirations. It

                  challenges, especially for the assessment of students’ texts.
                  Previous research has shown that people generally have
                  difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written
                  texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an
                  AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been
                  investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that
                  novice (N = 89) and experienced teachers (N = 200) could not
                  identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written
                  texts. However, there are some indications that more
                  experienced teachers made more differentiated and more
                  accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were
                  overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed

                  demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI
                  can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which

                  autonomy-supportive leadership, autonomy-thwarting
                  leadership), occupational experience (i.e., professional
                  growth striving, change-related stress), and background
                  factors (i.e., gender, age, teaching experience, contract
                  length, class size, school level) as predictors of motivation
                  (i.e., genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e.,
                  integration in teaching-related work and student learning
                  activities). Among 339 Australian teachers, our findings
                  revealed that perceived autonomy-supportive leadership,
                  professional growth striving, and change-related stress were

                  teaching-related work and student learning activities.
                  Perceived autonomy-thwarting leadership was directly linked
                  with greater genAI integration in student learning activities,

                  predicting student performance. The data utilized in this
                  study was collected from 253 undergraduate students
                  participating in five classes within one of three courses
                  offered by VnCodelab, an interactive learning management
                  system, to provide insights into student performance.
                  Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive
                  learning management system proposed earlier, this study
                  focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student
                  grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the
                  teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data
                  obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on
                  exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities.
                  This study compared five different base classifiers— Random
                  Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine
                  (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an
                  ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a
                  dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the
                  model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing
                  to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing
                  predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results
                  indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts
                  students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base
                  classification models by effectively combining their
                  predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting
                  into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching
                  methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered
                  learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive
                  learning community by empowering students with real-time
                  academic progress forecasts. Educators benefit from
                  data-informed insights that facilitate more effective and

  abstract     = {This study investigates how postsecondary learners employ
                  generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, to support their
                  self-directed learning (SDL) for writing purposes. Following a
                  sequential mixed methods design, we analyzed 384 survey
                  responses and 10 semi-structured interviews with postsecondary
                  writers. Findings suggest that the major learning task that
                  the learners used ChatGPT for writing is brainstorming and
                  seeking inspiration for ideas. While the entering motivation
                  for using ChatGPT varies from curiosity about innovative
                  technologies to fulfilling academic requirements, such
                  entering motivation transformed into task motivation when the
                  learners perceived the potential benefits of ChatGPT for
                  assisting their writing. In terms of self-management,
                  participants mostly demonstrated a high responsibility towards
                  their own learning with ChatGPT and employed various
                  strategies for SDL. Although survey respondents demonstrated a
                  comparatively low level of self-monitoring, most interviewees
                  claimed that they critically reflected on their learning
                  process and validated information provided by ChatGPT. There
                  are mixed opinions regarding whether the writing skills have
                  improved as a result of using ChatGPT. Some participants
                  suggested that the benefits brought by ChatGPT, such as
                  alleviating social pressure and receiving instant feedback at
                  any time, encouraged them to spend more time practicing
                  writing and making revisions. However, some argue that
                  assessing their AI-assisted SDL learning progress in the short
                  term is challenging. This study addresses gaps in the existing
                  literature where there is scarce, large-scale empirical
                  research on self-directed AI usage in writing, shedding light
                  on the emerging phenomenon of utilizing generative AI as a
                  means of SDL in writing.},

                  principles and its effects. Therefore, in this study, we
                  propose a curriculum that teaches the ethical use of large
                  language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and verify its impact on
                  educational effectiveness and technology acceptance among
                  students aged 12 to 24. The validation results show that the
                  proposed curriculum particularly contributes to the
                  understanding of LLM concepts and their ethical use in
                  decision support. We also demonstrate that experience using
                  ChatGPT influences the level of understanding of ethical
                  usage. Additionally, students aged 12 to 18 may actively adopt
                  ChatGPT responses in decision support, and careful
                  consideration is needed when using LLMs in the 12- to
                  18-year-old age group. Using technology acceptance model, AI
                  ethical principles were also examined to determine technology
                  acceptance, and it was found that usefulness, justice and
                  fairness, privacy, and data protection directly impact
                  attitudes toward ChatGPT. It has also become clear that

                  of their personal information. This result suggests that AI

                  intense debate about the effects generative AI (GAI) tools
                  will have on language teaching. The advanced capability of GAI
                  tools and their rapid uptake by students has brought both
                  challenges and opportunities to language teachers. This
                  qualitative study, using in-depth individual and group
                  interviews with ten beginning teachers and seventeen
                  first-year English language teachers, explored their readiness
                  for using GAI tools in their professional work and their
                  perceptions of GAI in language teaching. The study found that
                  first-year teachers were generally ready for the use of GAI
                  tools and could recognize its potential to support their
                  professional work. This was largely due to their experiences
                  using ChatGPT. However, beginning teachers were not ready to
                  use GAI tools in their professional work and had little

  abstract     = {The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence
                  (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has brought profound changes
                  to higher education. While many studies have examined the
                  potential use of ChatGPT in teaching and learning, few have
                  explored the opportunities to develop assessments that
                  facilitate the use of multiple technological innovations (i.e.
                  traditional AI and GenAI tools). We conducted qualitative
                  research to address this gap. The assessments of an elective
                  English course in Hong Kong were re-designed to incorporate
                  GenAI and other tools. Students were asked to employ and
                  reflect on their use of these tools for their writing
                  assessments. We analyzed the written reflections of 74
                  students and conducted focus group interviews with 28
                  students. The results suggest that the students possess an
                  acumen for choosing the appropriate online tools for specific
                  purposes. When they can choose freely, they develop skills
                  that allow them to evaluate and select between traditional AI
                  and GenAI tools when appropriate. Some students mentioned
                  concerns with the different features of the free and premium
                  versions. The results of this study call for (1) assessment
                  practices that allow the flexibility to use different AI tools
                  and (2) the equitable use of various AI tools.},

                  personal leisure, to collaborative professional work, to

                  prepare people for an interconnected, fast-changing world
                  which is increasingly becoming saturated with technological
                  devices and agentic machines. What kinds of capabilities do
                  people need in a world infused with AI? How can we
                  conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners
                  develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their
                  development? With this paper, we open the discussion by
                  adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of
                  11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written

                  capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop
                  them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and
                  methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine
                  our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we
                  propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views
                  of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology,

                  coaching, to investigate and interpret these differences.
                  Collaborative cultures comprise evolutionary relationships of
                  openness, trust, and support among teachers where they define
                  and develop their own purposes as a community. Contrived

                  implement the curricula and instructional strategies developed

               can be addressed using AI and social robots. We present a system

               content in real-time, adapting to students' skills through an
               engaging, visually-grounded game played alongside a social robot.
               To test effectiveness, we conducted a study in which Dutch high
               school students learned Spanish vocabulary either with or without
               the robot present. Results showed significant vocabulary gains
               regardless of robot presence, indicating the game itself, not the

                  ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools
                  in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and
                  teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for
                  self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge
                  learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational
                  practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools
                  can revolutionize educational practices and transform the
                  processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered.
                  It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly
                  become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who
                  craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop
                  students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from
                  neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ
                  generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate
                  active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and
                  encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also
                  reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI
                  literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip
                  students to meet future challenges. The practical application
                  of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the
                  development of Chinese language writing ability among primary
                  students within a K–12 educational context. This article also
                  reports the results of a 60-h development programme for
                  teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with
                  cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to
                  better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate
                  them into their teaching and learning and increased their
                  perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would
                  enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and

  abstract     = {Higher education is crucial for producing ethical citizens and
                  professionals globally. The introduction of generative AI
                  (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has posed opportunities and
                  challenges to the traditional model of education. However, the
                  current conversations primarily focus on policy development
                  and assessment, with limited research on the future of higher
                  education. GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and
                  assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the
                  workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student
                  perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study
                  uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic
                  literature review to investigate the opportunities and
                  challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an
                  initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51
                  students from three research-intensive universities was
                  selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three
                  themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future
                  higher education should be transformed to train students to be
                  future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI.
                  They suggest new learning outcomes—skills in learning and
                  teaching with GenAI, AI literacy—and emphasize the
                  significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with
                  assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities. They
                  recommend six future research directions – competence for
                  future workforce and its self-assessment measures, AI literacy
                  or competency measures, new literacies and their
                  relationships, interdisciplinary teaching, Innovative
                  pedagogies and their evaluation, new assessment and its
                  acceptance.},

                  will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education
                  (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university
                  in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn
                  predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed
                  eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were
                  analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis
                  and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in
                  HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent
                  technological developments. The results indicate concerns
                  exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however,
                  these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the
                  participants indicated they were using AI within their
                  teaching roles with the most common design change being
                  modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff
                  agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and
                  more than three quarters indicated they would like support.
                  They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping
                  in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by
                  preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the
                  HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to
                  ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in
                  response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future
                  developments will be extremely difficult to predict.},

                  up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in
                  higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA
                  principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a
                  full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the
                  data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and
                  coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022,
                  publications rose nearly two to three times the number of
                  previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE
                  publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that
                  research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the
                  world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in
                  the number of publications. Another new trend is in the
                  researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of
                  researchers from departments of education. This has now
                  changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate
                  students were the most studied students at 72\%. Similar to
                  the findings of other studies, language learning was the most
                  common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and
                  vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was
                  intended for 72\% of the studies focused on students, 17\%
                  instructors, and 11\% managers. In answering the overarching
                  question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used.
                  Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1)
                  Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4)
                  Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student
                  Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the
                  literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers,
                  including new tools, such as Chat GPT.},

                  feature more prominently in future educational discussions
                  around AI. These include: (i) the limited ways in which

  abstract     = {The interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in education has
                  erupted during the last few years, primarily due to
                  technological advances in AI. It is therefore argued that
                  students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly
                  how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been
                  suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to
                  acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI.
                  This study argues that researchers and educators need a
                  framework for integrating AI literacy into technological
                  literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This
                  study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different
                  components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation
                  to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI
                  literacy frameworks related to three traditions of
                  technological knowledge: technical skills, technological
                  scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical
                  understanding. The results show that AI literacy for
                  technology education emphasises technological scientific
                  knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise
                  AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical
                  understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI).
                  Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear
                  but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education
                  are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for
                  technology education is suggested.},

                  in K-12 science classrooms. In K-12 education, students
                  harness AI technologies to acquire scientific knowledge,
                  ranging from automated personalized virtual scientific inquiry
                  to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Sora, and Google Bard.
                  These AI technologies inherit various strengths and
                  limitations in facilitating students’ engagement in scientific
                  activities. There is a lack of framework to develop K-12
                  students’ epistemic considerations of the interaction between
                  the disciplines of AI and science when they engage in
                  producing, revising, and critiquing scientific knowledge using
                  AI technologies. To accomplish this, we conducted a systematic
                  review for studies that implemented AI technologies in science
                  education. Employing the family resemblance approach as our
                  analytical framework, we examined epistemic insights into
                  relationships between science and AI documented in the
                  literature. Our analysis centered on five distinct categories:
                  aims and values, methods, practices, knowledge, and
                  social–institutional aspects. Notably, we found that only
                  three studies mentioned epistemic insights concerning the
                  interplay between scientific knowledge and AI knowledge.
                  Building upon these findings, we propose a unifying framework
                  that can guide future empirical studies, focusing on three key
                  elements: (a) AI’s application in science and (b) the
                  similarities and (c) differences in epistemological approaches
                  between science and AI. We then conclude our study by
                  proposing a development trajectory for K-12 students’ learning
                  of AI-science epistemic insights.},

                  of ChatGPT as a virtual tutoring tool in STEM education are
                  rare. The current study investigated undergraduate students’
                  perceptions of using ChatGPT in a physics class as an
                  assistant tool for addressing physics questions. Specifically,
                  the study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering

                  and benefits. However, users also consider them a threat to
                  educational integrity and purposes. This research examined
                  ChatGPT usage among students in the United Arab Emirates
                  (UAE), their views, concerns, and perceived ethics. The data
                  was gathered from 388 students from two universities in Al Ain
                  city using Yamane's formula. Findings showed that students
                  consider ChatGPT a revolutionary technology that helps
                  students in many ways. The gathered data showed that the
                  effect of ChatGPT Usage remained significant on students'
                  views. The path analysis also supported the second hypothesis,
                  proposing the significant effect of ChatGPT on Students'
                  Concerns. Finally, the findings also indicated the validation

                  domains, including education from primary schools to
                  universities. However, practical testing and evaluation in
                  school education are still relatively unexplored. This article
                  examines the utilization of generative AI in primary school
                  education. The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8–14 years old,
                  studying in the 4th–6th grades across four classes in two
                  schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons
                  where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and
                  modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The
                  results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5,
                  as one example of generative AI, to personify learning
                  material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning

                  are the strongest predictors of a positive attitude toward
                  ChatGPT. The presence of positive emotions (β=0.418***) also
                  plays a significant role. Conversely, risk (β=-0.104**) and
                  boredom (β=-0.145**) demonstrate a negative yet less decisive
                  influence. These results provide an enhanced understanding of
                  how students perceive and utilize ChatGPTs, supporting a
                  unified theory of user behavior in educational technology
                  contexts. CONCLUSION: Ease of use, intention to use
                  frequently, acceptance, and intention to verify information
                  influenced the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT
                  responsibly. On the one hand, this study provides suggestions
                  for HEIs to improve their educational curricula to take
                  advantage of the potential benefits of AI and contribute to AI

                  article, we conduct a focused literature review to address two
                  central research inquiries concerning ChatGPT and similar AI
                  tools. Firstly, we examine the potential pitfalls linked with
                  the development and implementation of ChatGPT across the
                  individual, organizational, and societal levels. Secondly, we
                  explore the role of a multi-stakeholder responsible research
                  and innovation framework in guiding chatbots’ sustainable
                  development and utilization. Drawing inspiration from
                  responsible research and innovation and stakeholder theory

  abstract     = {In recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed
                  extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and
                  research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence
                  (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the
                  increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns
                  about their potential to automate teaching and research
                  processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various
                  fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its
                  impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by
                  examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher
                  education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an
                  online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants
                  across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender
                  categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and
                  cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of
                  awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents.
                  A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the
                  intention to continue using these tools, primarily for
                  information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study
                  emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher
                  education, highlighting both its potential benefits and
                  concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between
                  cultural dimensions and respondents’ views on the benefits and
                  concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic
                  dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore,
                  argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance
                  learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust
                  policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We
                  discussed the findings and offered recommendations for
                  researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote
                  the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher
                  education.},

                  is changing over time in terms of methods, content, concepts,
                  and models. Recently, it has been increasingly prevalent to
                  benefit from the potentialities of Artificial Intelligence
                  (AI) in addressing educational issues. In this research, the
                  current state of the art of the integration of AI in K-12
                  education was provided. Specifically, different parts of
                  education in which AI was employed along with the related AI
                  categories were discussed according to different K-12 grades
                  and courses. Additionally, technologies and environments that
                  contributed to employing AI in education were discussed. To
                  this end, a systematic literature review was conducted on
                  articles and conference papers published between 2011 and 2021
                  in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. As the result of
                  the initial search, 2075 documents were extracted and based on
                  inclusive criteria and 210 documents were identified for
                  further investigation. AI applications were categorized into
                  Student performance, Teaching, Selection, and Behavior tasks,
                  and Other. Machine Learning (ML) and Intelligent Tutoring
                  System (ITS) were the most common approaches among AI
                  categories. Furthermore, high school-related applications were
                  more frequent and STEM courses were substantially targeted by
                  AI. In conclusion, the remarkable impact of AI on education
                  was concluded. The current study reveals information about the
                  potentialities offered by AI in K-12 education which aids
                  researchers in implementing AI-based education systems. As for

                  increased in all education sectors including K-12 settings
                  where students can learn about AI and have an augmented
                  learning experience using AI. Purpose The purpose of this
                  systematic review is to provide a more complete and nuanced
                  understanding of the role and impact of AI in K-12 education
                  by synthesizing publication trends, AI research themes, AI
                  methods and technology applications, and AI use by students
                  and teachers in K-12 educational settings. Methods The
                  systematic review searched Web of Science and six databases
                  indexed in EBSCO host. A PRISMA flow chart was applied to
                  search and screen for studies. Articles were screened at the
                  title, abstract and full-text level and coded and analyzed.
                  Results Themes in 66 AI studies include AI as a predictor and
                  indicator of academic behavior or performance, AI curriculum
                  design, integrating AI in various subjects, evaluation of AI
                  in education, AI to enhance learning environments and school
                  operations, AI ethics, and the equity and safety of AI. AI
                  methods were grouped into Supervised Learning, Unsupervised
                  Learning and Reinforcement Learning. AI technology
                  applications were Machine Learning (ML) model building tools,
                  intelligent tutors, chat bot, educational games, AI robots and
                  virtual reality devices. AI applications were mostly used by
                  teachers for ML model demonstration, academic performance
                  prediction and behavior prediction. AI was used by students
                  for scientific discovery learning, improving learning
                  experience and data driven decisions. Conclusion This review
                  has implications for K-12 school personnel and researchers.
                  Practitioners can use the findings to implement AI in K-12

                  are the predominant research topics and their key findings?
                  (3) What is the status of major research design elements,
                  including guiding theories, methodologies, and research
                  contexts? A bibliometric analysis of 2,223 research articles
                  followed by a content analysis of selected 125 papers reveals
                  a comprehensive conceptual structure of the existing
                  literature. The extant AIED research spans a wide spectrum of
                  applications, encompassing those for adaptive learning and
                  personalized tutoring, intelligent assessment and management,
                  profiling and prediction, and emerging products. Research
                  topics delve into both the technical design of education
                  systems and the examination of the adoption, impacts, and
                  challenges associated with AIED. Furthermore, this review
                  highlights the diverse range of theories applied in the AIED
                  literature, the multidisciplinary nature of publication
                  venues, and underexplored research areas. In sum, this
                  research offers valuable insights for interested scholars to
                  comprehend the current state of AIED research and identify
                  future research opportunities in this dynamic field.},

                  Through qualitative content analysis of Swedish policy
                  documents and educational company reports, the study employs
                  the concept of Relevant Social Groups to assess how diverse
                  stakeholders perceive the risks and benefits of using AI in
                  education regarding fairness. Three distinct groups are

                  on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, evaluating the
                  AI literacy of pre-service teachers is crucial. As future
                  architects of educational systems, pre-service teachers must
                  not only possess pedagogical expertise but also a strong
                  foundation in AI literacy. This quantitative study examines AI
                  literacy among 529 pre-service teachers in a Nigerian
                  university, utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) for
                  comprehensive analysis. The research explores various
                  dimensions of AI literacy, revealing that a profound
                  understanding of AI significantly predicts positive outcomes
                  in AI use, detection, ethics, creation, and problem-solving.

                  This paper is based on the work conducted at the symposium

                  Collaboration in the Digital Age—From Creating Technologies to
                  Transforming Cultures” that took place in Engeltofta outside

                  scholars in collaborative analysis of design opportunities and
                  design trade-offs in relation to digital technologies and
                  learning and explored design strategies for systematically and

                  supporting the major argument of the paper that creating new
                  technologies is an important prerequisite to address the
                  fundamental challenge of transforming cultures. The
                  unanticipated but fundamental event of the occurrence of

                responsibility for fairness in education. We report on a current
                project aiming to increase the agency of secondary school
                teachers concerning the design and use of AI-based systems in
                education to ensure fairness. This paper reports on the use of a
                method called “provotypes”, in a project where teachers,
                students, principals and educational developers worked with the
                topic of fairness in the use of AI. Providing insights both on
                how the methods were used as well as the outcome of the use,
                i.e. methodological results and results concerning values on AI
                in education. The involvement of practitioners is important if
                not imperative to successful development of new technological
                solutions for the workplace (Fischer et al., 2004\& Bødker et
                al., 2009). This is claimed to support both the quality of
                design, and later implementation of new technologies (Sanders \&
                Stappers, 2008). Active involvement of relevant practitioners
                and stakeholders is central to ensure that new technologies do
                not endanger the freedom, values, and rights of practitioners
                (Bødker \& Kyng, 2018). Tension arising from contradicting
                values within stakeholder perspectives have primarily focused on
                developing strategies to achieve consensus among stakeholders or
                stakeholder groups (Grönvall et al., 2016; Jonas \& Hanrahan,
                2022). Rather than avoiding these tensions, they can be used as
                a resource by creating provocative prototypes (provotypes) that
                represent these tensions. In this way, provotypes serve as tools
                for stimulating creativity and encouraging new ideas by
                challenging norms and values while designing for future
                practices (Mogensen, 1994). The paper is guided by the research
                question: how do school stakeholders such as teachers, students,
                principals and school developers position themselves when
                confronted with Provotypes employing datadriven AI in
                educational practices? Tentatively, our results show varying
                positions, particularly between adults and students.
                Surprisingly, adults wanted to implement student monitoring and
                data driven support, despite expressed concerns about
                algorithmic unfairness. This may stem from the clash of
                technological solutions with conflicting educational values. In
                contrast, students expressed more concern regarding increased
                datafication and algorithmic decision-making in their
                educational practices. Provotypes proved to be a viable method
                for eliciting practitoners values, allowing and provoking
                students as well as teachers to make their positions towards AI
                in education explicit. Hence providing valuable input for future
                design work within this area.},

                  generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher
                  education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to
                  engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective
                  integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate
                  students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a
                  generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and
                  learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized
                  learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and
                  research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about
                  accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal
                  development, career prospects, and societal values were also
                  expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student
                  perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and
                  outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators
                  and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address
                  needs and concerns while promoting effective learning
                  outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy
                  development around the integration of GenAI technologies into
                  higher education. By understanding students’ perceptions and
                  addressing their concerns, policymakers can create
                  well-informed guidelines and strategies for the responsible
                  and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately

  abstract     = {Within a year of its launch, ChatGPT has seen a surge in
                  popularity. While many are drawn to its effectiveness and
                  user-friendly interface, ChatGPT also introduces moral
                  concerns, such as the temptation to present generated text as
                  one’s own. This led us to theorize that personality traits
                  such as Machiavellianism and sensation-seeking may be
                  predictive of ChatGPT usage. We launched two online
                  questionnaires with 2000 respondents each, in September 2023
                  and March 2024, respectively. In Questionnaire 1, 22\% of
                  respondents were students, and 54\% were full-time employees;
                  32\% indicated they used ChatGPT at least weekly. Analysis of
                  our ChatGPT Acceptance Scale revealed two factors,
                  Effectiveness and Concerns, which correlated positively and
                  negatively, respectively, with ChatGPT use frequency. A
                  specific aspect of Machiavellianism (manipulation tactics) was
                  found to predict ChatGPT usage. Questionnaire 2 was a
                  replication of Questionnaire 1, with 21\% students and 54\%
                  full-time employees, of which 43\% indicated using ChatGPT
                  weekly. In Questionnaire 2, more extensive personality scales
                  were used. We found a moderate correlation between
                  Machiavellianism and ChatGPT usage (r = 0.22) and with an
                  opportunistic attitude towards undisclosed use (r = 0.30),
                  relationships that largely remained intact after controlling
                  for gender, age, education level, and the respondents’
                  country. We conclude that covert use of ChatGPT is associated
                  with darker personality traits, something that requires
                  further attention.},

  abstract     = {In the context of (digital) human–machine interaction, people
                  are increasingly dealing with artificial intelligence in
                  everyday life. Through this, we observe humans who embrace
                  technological advances with a positive attitude. Others,
                  however, are particularly sceptical and claim to foresee
                  substantial problems arising from such uses of technology. The
                  aim of the present study was to introduce a short measure to
                  assess the Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence (ATAI
                  scale) in the German, Chinese, and English languages.
                  Participants from Germany (N = 461; 345 females), China (N =
                  413; 145 females), and the UK (N = 84; 65 females) completed
                  the ATAI scale, for which the factorial structure was tested
                  and compared between the samples. Participants from Germany
                  and China were additionally asked about their willingness to
                  interact with/use self-driving cars, Siri, Alexa, the social
                  robot Pepper, and the humanoid robot Erica, which are
                  representatives of popular artificial intelligence products.
                  The results showed that the five-item ATAI scale comprises two
                  negatively associated factors assessing (1) acceptance and (2)
                  fear of artificial intelligence. The factor structure was
                  found to be similar across the German, Chinese, and UK
                  samples. Additionally, the ATAI scale was validated, as the
                  items on the willingness to use specific artificial
                  intelligence products were positively associated with the ATAI
                  Acceptance scale and negatively with the ATAI Fear scale, in
                  both the German and Chinese samples. In conclusion we
                  introduce a short, reliable, and valid measure on the attitude
                  towards artificial intelligence in German, Chinese, and
                  English language.},

                  already being discussed. In order to create an empirical basis
                  for this, a nationwide survey of students was carried out in
                  order to analyse the use and possible characteristics of
                  AI-based tools that are important to students. The aim of the
                  quantitative study is to be able to draw conclusions about how
                  students use such AI tools. A total of more than 6300 students
                  across Germany took part in the anonymous survey. The results
                  of this quantitative analysis make it clear that almost
                  two-thirds of the students surveyed use or have used AI-based
                  tools as part of their studies. In this context, almost half
                  of the students explicitly mention ChatGPT or GPT-4 as a tool
                  they use. Students of engineering sciences, mathematics and
                  natural sciences use AI-based tools most frequently. A
                  differentiated examination of the usage behaviour makes it
                  clear that students use AI-based tools in a variety of ways.

                  the article is a recent state programme that encourages

                  arrangements enable and constrain practices associated with
                  educator learning? In this article, we explore two case
                  studies of action research projects: one undertaken with
                  Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) teachers,
                  and the other undertaken with Swedish principals. Using the
                  theory of practice architectures and the Professional Learning
                  Framework (see text), we consider what action research team
                  members identified that they learnt through the action
                  research projects, and what enabled and constrained that
                  learning. The findings highlight five key themes that enabled
                  and constrained educator professional learning and supported
                  educators in making positive changes in their professional
                  practice: power and solidarity, trust, recognition, agency and

                  highlighted as important factors in supporting educator

                  enable educator professional learning, can support the

                  chatbot, into educational settings, has caused mixed reactions
                  among educators. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review
                  to explore the strengths and weaknesses of using ChatGPT and
                  discuss the opportunities and threats of using ChatGPT in
                  teaching and learning.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA flowchart
                  guidelines, 51 articles were selected among 819 studies
                  collected from Scopus, ERIC and Google Scholar databases in
                  the period from 2022-2023.ResultsThe synthesis of data
                  extracted from the 51 included articles revealed 32 topics
                  including 13 strengths, 10 weaknesses, 5 opportunities and 4
                  threats of using ChatGPT in teaching and learning. We used
                  Biggs’s Presage-Process-Product (3P) model of teaching and
                  learning to categorize topics into three components of the 3P
                  model.DiscussionIn the Presage stage, we analyzed how ChatGPT
                  interacts with student characteristics and teaching contexts
                  to ensure that the technology adapts effectively to diverse
                  needs and backgrounds. In the Process stage, we analyzed how

                  the educational agenda raising expectations on teachers’ and
                  teacher educators’ professional knowledge. This scoping review
                  examines how the scientific literature conceptualises AI
                  literacy in relation to teachers’ different forms of
                  professional knowledge relevant for Teacher Education (TE).
                  The search strategy included papers and proceedings from 2000
                  to 2023 related to AI literacy and TE as well as the
                  intersection of AI and teaching. Thirty-four papers were
                  included in the analysis. The Aristotelian concepts episteme
                  (theoretical-scientific knowledge), techne
                  (practical-productive knowledge), and phronesis (professional
                  judgement) were used as a lens to capture implicit and
                  explicit dimensions of teachers’ professional knowledge.
                  Results indicate that AI literacy is a globally emerging
                  research topic in education but almost absent in the context
                  of TE. The literature covers many different topics and draws
                  on different methodological approaches. Computer science and
                  exploratory teaching approaches influence the type of
                  epistemic, practical, and ethical knowledge. Currently,
                  teachers’ professional knowledge is not broadly addressed or
                  captured in the research. Questions of ethics are
                  predominantly addressed as a matter of understanding technical
                  configurations of data-driven AI technologies. Teachers’
                  practical knowledge tends to translate into the adoption of
                  digital resources for teaching about AI or the integration of
                  AI EdTech into teaching. By identifying several research gaps,
                  particularly concerning teachers' practical and ethical
                  knowledge, this paper adds to a more comprehensive
                  understanding of AI literacy in teaching and can contribute to
                  a more well-informed AI literacy education in TE as well as
                  laying the ground for future research related to teachers’
                  professional knowledge.},

                  with a framework for developing AI Readiness training. ‘AI
                  Readiness’ can be framed as a contextualised way of helping
                  people to understand AI, in particular, data-driven AI. The
                  nature of AI Readiness training is not the same as merely
                  learning about AI. Rather, AI Readiness recognises the
                  diversity of the professions, workplaces and sectors for whom
                  AI has a potential impact. For example, AI Readiness for
                  lawyers may be based on the same principles as AI Readiness
                  for Educators. However, the details will be contextualised
                  differently. AI Readiness recognises that such
                  contextualisation is not an option: it is essential due to the
                  multiple intricacies, sensitivities and variations between
                  different sectors and their settings, which all impact the
                  application of AI. To embrace such contextualisation, AI
                  Readiness needs to be an active, participatory training
                  process and aims to empower people to be more able to leverage
                  AI to meet their needs. The text that follows focuses on AI
                  Readiness within the Education and Training sector and starts
                  with a discussion of the current state of AI within education
                  and training, and the need for AI Readiness. We then
                  problematize the concept of AI Readiness, why AI Readiness is
                  needed, and what it means. We expand upon the nature of AI
                  Readiness through a discussion of the difference between human
                  and Artificial Intelligence, before presenting a 7-step
                  framework for helping people to become AI Ready. Finally, we
                  use an example of AI Readiness in action within Higher
                  Education to exemplify AI Readiness.},

                  have made the leap from computer science journals to
                  open-source communities and commercial services. Pre-trained
                  DL models built on massive datasets, also known as foundation
                  models, such as the GPT-3 and BERT, have led the way in
                  democratizing artificial intelligence (AI). However, their
                  potential use as research tools has been overshadowed by fears
                  of how this technology can be misused. Some have argued that
                  AI threatens scholarship, suggesting they should not replace
                  human collaborators. Others have argued that AI creates
                  opportunities, suggesting that AI-human collaborations could
                  speed up research. Taking a constructive stance, this
                  editorial outlines ways to use foundation models to advance
                  science. We argue that DL tools can be used to create
                  realistic experiments and make specific types of quantitative
                  studies feasible or safer with synthetic rather than real
                  data. All in all, we posit that the use of generative AI and
                  foundation models as a tool in information systems research is
                  in very early stages. Still, if we proceed cautiously and
                  develop clear guidelines for using foundation models and
                  generative AI, their benefits for science and scholarship far
                  outweigh their risks.},

                  and evolved a number of variants. This review examined
                  highly-ranked educational journals to determine grounded
                  theory methodologies used most frequently by educational
                  researchers. A total of 210 studies from 15 education journals
                  were analyzed across 18 years of publication. A coding scheme
                  was developed and used to categorize studies by type of
                  methodological approach and inclusion of common grounded
                  theory elements. Increasing variability in the types of
                  grounded theory approaches was found in educational research
                  over the last two decades. While educational researchers
                  appear to prefer Straussian approaches to the design and
                  analysis of grounded theory studies, Charmaz?s constructivist
                  approach has increased in popularity over the last decade. In
                  addition, most educational researchers used grounded theory as
                  a data analysis technique rather than as a complete
                  methodological approach. Only a small proportion of the 210
                  studies (29.5\%) delineated a ?grounded theory.? Finally,
                  despite their publication in highly-ranked educational
                  journals, methodological inconsistencies and descriptive
                  cloudiness were evidenced across many of these grounded theory
                  studies.},

               potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective
               prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based

               learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human
               instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were
               barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have

                  technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical
                  issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and
                  skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the
                  emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI
                  literacy in everyday life, little is known about its
                  determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI
                  literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on
                  previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The
                  model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and
                  computational thinking. As a major finding from the current
                  study, computational thinking was found to be a significant
                  determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using,
                  recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover,

                  that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly advancing. As
                  part of this development, large language models (LLMs) are
                  increasingly being used when humans interact with systems
                  based on artificial intelligence (AI), posing both new
                  opportunities and challenges. When interacting with LLM-based
                  AI system in a goal-directed manner, prompt engineering has
                  evolved as a skill of formulating precise and well-structured
                  instructions to elicit desired responses or information from
                  the LLM, optimizing the effectiveness of the interaction.
                  However, research on the perspectives of non-experts using
                  LLM-based AI systems through prompt engineering and on how AI
                  literacy affects prompting behavior is lacking. This aspect is
                  particularly important when considering the implications of
                  LLMs in the context of higher education. In this present
                  study, we address this issue, introduce a skill-based approach
                  to prompt engineering, and explicitly consider the role of
                  non-experts' AI literacy (students) in their prompt
                  engineering skills. We also provide qualitative insights into
                  students’ intuitive behaviors towards LLM-based AI systems.
                  The results show that higher-quality prompt engineering skills
                  predict the quality of LLM output, suggesting that prompt
                  engineering is indeed a required skill for the goal-directed
                  use of generative AI tools. In addition, the results show that
                  certain aspects of AI literacy can play a role in higher
                  quality prompt engineering and targeted adaptation of LLMs
                  within education. We, therefore, argue for the integration of
                  AI educational content into current curricula to enable a
                  hybrid intelligent society in which students can effectively
                  use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to explore the content of teachers’
                  CPD. In particular, it focuses on how CPD content relates to
                  teachers’ dual task of equipping pupils with knowledge and
                  values. Theoretically, the study is based on Basil Bernstein’s
                  concept of pedagogical discourse and the related analytical
                  concepts of instructional and regulative discourse. The
                  article employs a ‘follow the money’ approach; data were
                  collected from invoices for teachers’ CPD in three Swedish
                  municipalities. Since municipal invoices are official
                  documents in Sweden, CPD invoices for compulsory and upper
                  secondary school teachers from 2018 to 2019 were requested
                  from each municipality. Of the submitted invoices, 679 were
                  determined to be relevant to the study, but 170 of these were
                  excluded from the analysis, as they did not concern teaching.
                  Information was extracted from the invoices and coded into a
                  SPSS file that includes several variables. This study examines
                  six main variables: pedagogical discourse, CPD content, school
                  subject, CPD actor, school type and desired changes. The
                  variable of pedagogical discourse was further divided into the
                  following five sub-categories: instructional subject discourse
                  (pupils’ acquisition of subject matter knowledge);
                  instructional competence discourse (pupils’ development of
                  basic skills or competences); regulative discourse (pupils’
                  behaviour, identity, attitude etc.); discourse blend (CPD
                  focusing on both instructional and regulative discourses) and
                  other (CPD not related to teaching). The data were analysed
                  using descriptive statistics, mainly via cross tabulations
                  computed in SPSS, to explore the distribution of invoices
                  across the main variables and the relationships among the
                  variables. The results illustrate the degree to which CPD
                  content focuses on instructional or regulative discourse. We
                  identified 188 invoices (37\%) related to regulative
                  discourse. Here, most content relates to conflict management
                  and other forms of challenging student behaviour. We
                  identified 127 invoices (25\%) relating to instructional
                  subject discourse; most were related to mathematics, VET
                  subjects or physical education. We identified 95 invoices
                  (19\%) related to instructional competence discourse. Most of
                  these focus on programs and materials that aim to support
                  pupils with counting, reading, writing and communication
                  disabilities. We identified 99 invoices (19\%) related to a
                  blend of discourses; the patterns here reinforce those
                  identified in the other discursive categories. The results
                  also illustrate several relationships among discursive
                  orientation, school type (compulsory vs upper secondary
                  school) and type of CPD actor. For example, compulsory school
                  teachers receive more CPD from commercial actors than upper
                  secondary school teachers. Meanwhile, upper secondary school
                  teachers receive more CPD from universities and other
                  interested organizations. We also found that upper secondary
                  school teachers receive more subject-specific CPD than
                  compulsory school teachers, who, in turn, are more engaged in
                  activities that concern pupils’ behaviour. Finally, we find
                  that the content of teachers’ CPD is characterized by
                  intra-individual ambitions for pupils’ change rather than by
                  ambitions for intergroup change, or equalizing differences
                  among sociologically defined groups. The study concludes that
                  the CPD offered to teachers in the studied municipalities
                  reflects teachers’ dual task, which is characterized by
                  reproduction of social class.},

                  into leadership practice is rare. This paper reports on
                  principals’ changes in their pedagogical leadership after a
                  three-year professional development initiative in a Swedish
                  municipality including all 70 principals. Theoretical point of
                  departure is sensemaking and dimensions of pedagogical
                  leadership. Data consist of semi-structured interviews with 15
                  of the participating principals. The analysis shows that
                  participating in the initiative gave principals knowledge

                  har fått ett betydande genomslag i svensk skola, både i form
                  av den kompetensutvecklingsmodell genom vilken begreppet
                  initierades (fortsättningsvis kollegialt lärande-modellen) och
                  genom begreppets stora spridning i allmän skoldiskussion.
                  Denna studie undersöker det tidiga formandet av kollegialt
                  lärande-modellen 2011-2012 och belyser de antaganden modellen
                  vilar på. Med utgångspunkt i Bacchis (2009) angreppssätt
                  ”What’s the problem represented to be?” undersöker vi hur de
                  problem som modellen förväntades lösa representeras i texter
                  som omgärdar modellens framväxt. Kollegialt lärande-modellen
                  analyseras även i ett professionsteoretiskt perspektiv, för

                  visar att kollegialt lärande-modellen representerades som en
                  lösning på bristfällig matematikundervisning och byggde på
                  antaganden om att lokala aktörer inte förmådde hantera
                  problemen. Myntandet av begreppet ”kollegialt lärande”
                  framstår som ett sätt att framställa
                  kompetensutvecklingsmodellen som underbyggd av forskning, utan
                  att kräva förankring i specifika forskningsbaserade begrepp
                  och modeller. En betoning på likvärdigt genomförande
                  motiverade att modellen gavs ett standardiserat upplägg och
                  innehåll. Denna standardisering möjliggjorde att en
                  professionell kunskapsbas kunde erbjudas, samtidigt som
                  lärargruppers möjligheter att utveckla och utöva professionell
                  autonomi begränsades.},

                  critiqued for a lack of theoretical grounding. In this article
                  we propose a conceptual framework for educational technology
                  by building on Shulman's formulation of "pedagogical content
                  knowledge" and extend it to the phenomenon of teachers
                  integrating technology into their pedagogy. This framework is
                  the result of 5 years of work on a program of research focused
                  on teacher professional development and faculty development in
                  higher education. It attempts to capture some of the essential
                  qualities of teacher knowledge required for technology
                  integration in teaching, while addressing the complex,
                  multifaceted, and situated nature of this knowledge. We argue,
                  briefly, that thoughtful pedagogical uses of technology
                  require the development of a complex, situated form of
                  knowledge that we call Technological Pedagogical Content
                  Knowledge (TPCK). In doing so, we posit the complex roles of,
                  and interplay among, three main components of learning
                  environments: content, pedagogy, and technology. We argue that
                  this model has much to offer to discussions of technology
                  integration at multiple levels: theoretical, pedagogical, and
                  methodological. In this article, we describe the theory behind
                  our framework, provide examples of our teaching approach based
                  upon the framework, and illustrate the methodological
                  contributions that have resulted from this work.},

                  sense of categories of progressive inquiry made available to
                  them through a discussion and inquiry type of software called
                  Future Learning Environments 2 (FLE2). The idea behind tools
                  of this kind is to induce approaches to school-work that build
                  on the metaphor of learning as research. By pursuing a
                  socio-cultural perspective on the topic of categories and
                  categorization, we analyse in detail how students make sense
                  of these categories, including how their sense-making relates
                  to other concerns they have to manage when engaged in the
                  institutional practices of studying. We demonstrate that
                  students encounter significant challenges when engaged in the
                  categorization work required by FLE2 and its underlying
                  pedagogical model of progressive inquiry. Therefore, we
                  conclude that to develop educational practices similar to the
                  scientific practices on which such tools rely is more complex
                  than merely following a step-by-step model of inquiry. To be
                  able to evaluate truth claims and factuality involves the
                  mastery of a whole range of historically developed skills and
                  knowledge, and it is therefore not surprising that the
                  students find it difficult to make adequate interpretations of
                  what the categories entail, and how they should be used.},

                  pretation of Web history, including enough progress in certain
                  direc- tions to trigger a succession. The label casts the
                  reader back to Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s unleashing of the World
                  Wide Web concept a little more than a decade ago, then asks:
                  What forms of the Web have developed A New Wave of Innovation
                  for Teaching and Learning? and become accepted enough that we
                  can conceive of a transition to new ones? ■ Many
                  people—including, or perhaps especially, support- ers—critique
                  the “Web 2.0” moniker for definitional reasons. Few can agree
                  on even the general outlines of Web 2.0. It is about no single
                  new development. Moreover, the term is often applied to a
                  heterogeneous mix of relatively familiar and also very
                  emergent technologies. The former may appear as very much “Web
                  1.0,” and the latter may be seen as too evanescent to be
                  relied on for serious informatics work. Indeed, one leading
                  exponent of this movement deems continuous improve- ment to be
                  a hallmark of such projects, which makes pinning down their
                  identities even more difficult.1 Yet we can survey the ground
                  tra- versed by Web 2.0 projects and discussions in order to
                  reveal a diverse set of digital strategies with powerful
                  implications for higher educa- tion.2 Ultimately, the label
                  “Web 2.0” is far less important than the con- cepts, projects,
                  and practices included in its scope. By},

               construction of knowledge. New learning environments, in many
               cases supported by computer technology, are often based on
               collaborating and sharing expertise. As a result research on
               Computer Supported Collaborative learning (CSCL) environments is
               a significant and growing field, which actively seeks new methods
               to resolve the challenges of human learning across diverse levels
               of interaction in a modern information society. In this chapter
               we will discuss the concept of collaborative learning and the
               issues involved in using information and communication technology
               to support collaborative learning. We begin with the definition
               of collaboration, which lays the foundation for diverse research
               perspectives and methodologies on collaborative learning. The
               chapter also reviews the potential of CSCL environments, and

  abstract     = {This paper explores some of the ideas behind the Personal
                  Learning Environment and considers why PLEs might be useful or
                  indeed central to learning in the future. This is not so much
                  a technical question as an educational one, although changing
                  technologies are key drivers in educational change. The paper
                  starts by looking at the changing face of education and goes
                  on to consider the different ways in which the so-called net
                  generation is using technology for learning. It goes on to
                  consider some of the pressures for change in the present
                  education systems. The idea of a Personal Learning Environment
                  recognises that learning is ongoing and seeks to provide tools
                  to support that learning. It also recognises the role of the
                  individual in organising his or her own learning. Moreover,
                  the pressures for a PLE are based on the idea that learning
                  will take place in different contexts and situations and will
                  not be provided by a single learning provider. Linked to this
                  is an increasing recognition of the importance of informal
                  learning. The paper also looks at changing technology,
                  especially the emergence of ubiquitous computing and the
                  development of social software. The paper believes that we are
                  coming to realise that we cannot simply reproduce previous
                  forms of learning, the classroom or the university, embodied
                  in software. Instead, we have to look at the new opportunities
                  for learning afforded by emerging technologies. Social
                  software offers the opportunity to narrow the divide between
                  producers and consumers. Consumers themselves become
                  producers, through creating and sharing. One implication is
                  the potential for a new ecology of open content, books,
                  learning materials and multimedia, through learners themselves
                  becoming producers of learning materials. Social software has
                  already led to the widespread adoption of portfolios for
                  learners, bringing together learning from different contexts
                  and sources of learning and providing an ongoing record of
                  lifelong learning, capable of expression in different forms.
                  The paper considers how Personal Learning Environments might
                  be developed through the aggregation of different services.
                  The final section provides examples of practices that show how
                  PLEs may be used in the future.},

                  Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), a sociotechnical interaction
                  network (STIN) designed to support a Web-based community of
                  in-service and preservice mathematics and science teachers
                  sharing, improving, and creating inquiry-based pedagogical
                  prac- tices. Specifically, we apply activity theory as an
                  analytical lens for characterizing the process of de- signing
                  and supporting the implementation of this online community.
                  Our findings lend support for three implications. First,
                  activity theory can provide a useful analytical tool for
                  characterizing design activity, especially in terms of
                  illuminating the challenges of designing something like
                  community. Second, as onemovestoward trying to design a
                  community, particularly one in which thememberswill be
                  expected to engage in new practices that challenge their
                  current culture, many tensions emerge. Third, consideration of
                  the ILF as a STIN was a necessary conceptual step in our
                  understanding of the ILF and the transactional nature of
                  people and tools. It is our conception that activity theory
                  and STIN are synergistic theoretical frameworks that, when
                  taken together, can provide a richer view of design activity
                  and community functioning than either can offer in isolation.

  abstract  = {He who does not live in some degree for others, hardly lives for
               himself. Montaigne Openness begets openness; that is the hope.
               But can openness sustain itself? That is an essential question.
               Both open educational content (OEC) and open source software
               (OSS) have generated cultures of openness among the institutions
               and individuals who have embraced them. The members of those
               cultures have discovered new effi ciencies, new opportunities for
               productivity (social production), new forms of organization
               (coopetition), new markets (the long tail), new pathways to
               learning, and new models for engaging with their colleagues and
               others around the sharing and collaborative construction of
               intellectual property. However, the jury is still out on whether
               these two cultures are each sustainable, and whether they can
               help each other to achieve sustainability. This chapter discusses
               some of the challenges facing OSS development and attempts to
               draw lessons from them for the OEC community. It makes a few key
               points: that multiple models of both OEC and OSS are possible;
               that each model has different strengths and weaknesses; and that
               the approaches one takes to sustainability will depend in
               important ways on the models of openness that one wishes to
               encourage. My programs grantees and other partners inform the
               analysis in this chapter; however, the views expressed here are
               my own. Openness is a controversial topic. Even people who agree
               on its desirability can disagree over what openness really means
               and how best to achieve it. My colleagues and grantees hold
               diverse views on the various openness 120 Chapter 8 movements, as
               refl ected in the diversity of the Foundations openness
               initiatives, which range from the development of OSS through
               Mellon/ RIT, to the information accessibility and digitization
               initiatives of the Mellon Scholarly Communication Program, to the
               subscription models of Mellon-supported organizations such as
               JSTOR, ARTstor, Aluka, and Portico, to Mellons extensive support
               of the OpenCourseWare initiative. Many of us hope that openness
               can be achieved broadly and deeply throughout the educational
               sphere, but the analyses and evaluations on which the
               recommendations in this chapter are based do not necessarily refl
               ect the views of my colleagues or the Mellon Foundation. OSS
               Limitations and CSS For all that the OSS movement has produced
               some runaway successes, including projects like Perl, Linux, and
               Mozilla Firefox, there appear to be certain types of challenges
               that are diffi cult for OSS to tackle. Most notably,
               voluntaristic OSS projects struggle to launch products whose
               primary customers are institutions rather than individuals: fi
               nancial or HR systems rather than Web servers or browsers; or
               uniform, manageable desktop environments rather than programming
               languages or operating systems. This limitation may trace to any
               of several factors: the number of programmers having the special
               expertise required to deliver an enterprise information system
               may be too small to sustain a community; the software may be
               inherently too unglamorous or uninteresting to attract
               volunteers; the benefi ts of the software may be too diffuse to
               encourage benefi ciaries to collaborate to produce it; the
               software may be too complex for its development to be coordinated
               on a purely volunteer basis; the software may require the active,
               committed participation of specifi c fi rms or institutions
               having strong disincentives to participate in OSS; and so on. Any
               of these factors might be enough to prevent the successful
               formation of an OSS project, and there are many useful types of
               enterprise softwareincluding much of the enterprise software
               needed by higher education institutionsto which several of them
               apply. In short, however well a standard OSS approach may work
               for many projects, there is little reason to believe that the
               same model can work for every conceivable software project. Open
               Source in Open Education 121 Some higher education and other
               nonprofi t institutions, recognizing the limitations of the
               classic OSS strategy, have evolved a variant that attempts to
               launch OSS projects for environments in which the classic model
               appears impossible. This variant brings to the fore the patronage
               dynamics, governance supports, and incentive structures obscured
               in the classic model and makes them the centerpiece of the
               strategy. Under this new model, several institutions contract
               together to build software for a common need, with the intent of
               releasing that software as open source. The institutions form a
               virtual development organization consisting of employees seconded
               from each of the partners. This entity is governed cooperatively
               by the partners and managed as if it were an enterprise software
               development organization, with project and team leads,
               architects, developers, and usability specialists, and all the
               trappings of organizational life, including reporting
               relationships and formal incentive structures. During and after
               the initial construction phase, the consortial partners open the
               project and invite in anyone who cares to contribute; over time
               the project evolves into a more ordinary OSS project, albeit one
               in which institutions rather than individual volunteers usually
               continue to play a major role. This variant is sometimes called
               directed open source but is becoming better known as community
               source software (CSS). The relative deprecation of altruism as a
               value by CSS, and its replacement with an emphasis on
               intelligently structured incentives, has implications for how CSS
               projects organize themselves. CSS products typically take several
               years to reach market, and partners need to be confi dent that
               each participant organization will continue to contribute for the
               duration. As one CSS partner put it, if we get a new Provost
               tomorrow who wants to know why our people are being paid by us
               and taking up our space but reporting to someone at another
               university to build software that were going to give away for
               free, I cant respond by talking about altruistic benefi ts to
               higher education or the virtues of open source: I need to have a
               spreadsheet that shows clearly why it is in our institutional
               interest to keep doing this. Statements like that strike some OSS
               supporters as mercenary, but essentially the same calculusperhaps
               better hidden from viewinforms institutional patronage of OSS
               projects as well. CSS is not fundamentally different from OSS;
               rather, 122 Chapter 8 it recognizes the hidden sustainability
               dynamics of OSS and harnesses them more explicitly. CSS has
               demonstrated its ability to build enterprise-scale software that
               can compete on features with commercial offerings; examples
               include the Sakai collaborative learning environment and the
               newer Kuali Financial System. Sakai is now in use or in pilot at
               more than 100 institutions and is growing more rapidly in
               adoption than many commercial systems. Kuali Financials offered
               its fi rst public release only a few months ago, and a few
               smaller institutions are already adopting it; the rest of the
               projects are still pre-release. The initial successes of CSS have
               been visible enough that other projects are currently underway.
               Kuali, in particular, has already spawned projects to produce
               research administration tools and student information systems,
               and there is reportedly some interest in building a Kuali HR
               system and a library automation system as well. The institutional
               orientation of CSS may be a powerful stabilizing and
               sustainability factor. CSS as a concept is substantially newer
               than OSS, however, and the jury remains out. Advocates argue that
               the institutional commitment is itself a guarantee of stability.
               Institutions do not replace these systems quickly, so a community
               of supporters is guaranteed for at least the medium term, making
               CSS potentially even a safer bet than a commercial product from a
               vendor that may be bought-out at any moment. The advocates have
               logic on their side, but many higher education CIOs
               understandably want to see empirical evidence that the logic is
               sound before they commit to joining these projects. OEC
               Differences from OSS, CSS If we have learned one thing about
               sustaining openness through the work of Mellon/RIT, it is that
               project sustainability results from the careful alignment of
               producers and consumers interests, so that each party gains
               something of value from the cooperative project. Traditional OSS
               usually aligns those interests straightforwardly, because the
               producers of the software are generally also its users. In cases
               where producers and consumers are not the same people but are
               both members of the same organizations, CSS may prove to work
               better because it makes the organizations, rather than the
               individuals, both producers and consumers. Other models for
               sustainability have been attempted, but if one cannot Open Source
               in Open Education 123 align producer and consumer interests
               effectively, then the only other demonstrated way to keep a
               project viable is by means of an ongoing, outside cash infusion,
               as when a commercial vendor adopts an OSS project. This makes the
               donor a single point of failure for the entire project, and if
               the donor is a commercial entity, it may also introduce important
               confl icts of interest. One signifi cant difference between OSS
               and OEC is that the alignment of producer with consumer interests
               in OSS production is voluntary, while the alignment of interests
               in CSS and OEC production usually is not. Once an institution
               chooses to join a CSS initiative, it assigns staff to the project
               as it would to any other software project; some voluntary choice
               may be involved, but staffi ng a CSS project is a job, not a
               hobby. Similarly, an institution may choose to join an open
               content initiative and may even ask for faculty volunteers. So
               far, at least, institutions usually end up compensating or
               subsidizing faculty in some way for participationand I know of no
               institution that},

               man, but as a network of interactions relating the individual

                  volume of research production in education ethnography in
                  Scandinavia due partly to a regionally financed network. The
                  present article makes some comparisons between Scandinavian
                  and other education research contexts in relation to aspects
                  of general ethnographic design to try to analyse this
                  production. It suggests some typical points of identity for
                  Scandinavian educational ethnography, such as a distinct role
                  for theories in fieldwork. But it also suggests that these
                  characteristics are even apparent outside Scandinavia. Some
                  blind-spots in ethnography are also suggested around
                  quantitative aspects, but again, these are not unique.
                  Scandinavian ethnographic research in education is broadly
                  influenced by a range of different traditions in different
                  parts of the region that have travelled with key people and
                  from place to place, but it is also noted that there is
                  seepage between ethnography and other traditions. © 2010

                  ways in which issues of race and ethnicity are represented and
                  researched in educational ethnography in Scandinavia. Several
                  things are suggested. Amongst them is that educational
                  ethnographers in Scandinavia rarely use the concept of race.
                  The term (im)migrant(s) is used instead and the relationships
                  in education between Scandinavians and (im)migrants and
                  between educational results and (im)migrant culture and/or
                  languages are often in focus. Integration has also been an
                  issue. History may give an indication as to how this may have
                  become so. Research on immigrants, immigration and integration
                  has been promoted in national policies and these policies
                  highlight language, culture and diversity but for historical
                  and political reasons they often avoid ethnicity and ignore
                  race and colour altogether. Moreover, when ethnicity is used
                  it seems to be used more as an ontological marker than as an
                  epistemological concept. This has repercussions we suggest for
                  understanding the politics of race and ethnicity relations in
                  relation to education. © 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

                  attempts to offer a methodological contribution of online
                  communication and an exploration of initial empirical data
                  generated with this methodology. The article calls for a
                  specification of how ethnography can be applied appropriately
                  to the study of relationships online. It departs from the real
                  versus virtual dichotomy, offering a user-centred methodology
                  to study interpersonal communications on the internet. It
                  suggests the use of three main strategies to pay tribute to
                  the characteristics of uses online: multi-situated, online and
                  offline, and flexible and multimedia data collection methods.
                  This approach facilitates a holistic analysis of the way in
                  which social information and communication technologies
                  operate within society in everyday life. It deals with the
                  problem of defining the setting of research online and
                  proposes an expanded ethnography. The article specifies
                  details of this methodology for research into interpersonal
                  communications and emotions online. It does so by drawing on
                  empirical data generated in a study on everyday life and
                  emotions on the internet. Epistemic questions related to this
                  methodological approach will also be discussed. Overall, the
                  exemplification suggests that the methodological approach
                  proposed here is able to capture the uses and understandings
                  of the internet.},

                  multidimensional rather than unidimensional as it is domain
                  specific in nature. However, each specific self-concept domain
                  may be further separated into competence and affect
                  components. This study examines the twofold
                  multidimensionality of academic self-concept (i.e., its domain
                  specificity and competenceaffect distinction) and extends
                  previous research by applying both within-network and
                  between-network approaches to construct validation. The
                  academic self-concept scales of a German version of the Self
                  Description Questionnaire I (SDQ I) were administered to
                  students from 3rd to 6th grades (N = 1,958). Confirmatory
                  factor analysis models positing separate factors for
                  competence and affect components of math, German, and general
                  school self-concepts fitted better than models assuming domain
                  specificity only. This was demonstrated for the total sample
                  as well as for different subsamples based on age and gender.
                  Although the competence and affect components within each
                  academic self-concept domain were substantially correlated,
                  they were found to be separable constructs. In between-network
                  studies, the competence component was found to be more highly
                  correlated with achievement than the affect component within
                  and across matching academic domains, providing a new argument
                  for the separation of competence and affect components of
                  academic self-concept. Implications of the distinctiveness of
                  competence and affect components of academic self-concept for
                  self-concept theory, research, and practice are discussed.},

                  question of how institutional contexts contribute to
                  constituting the meanings and functions of CSCL applications.
                  The argument that we develop here concerns how the
                  institutional context impacts the use of CSCL applications and
                  how this impact should be conceptualized. In order to
                  structure to our argument, we introduce a distinction between
                  systemic and dialogic approaches to CSCL research. We develop
                  our argument by working through a selection of relevant
                  studies belonging to the two perspectives, and conclude that
                  not enough attention has been given to the emergent
                  characteristics of activities where CSCL tools have been
                  introduced. This is particularly the case in studies belonging
                  to a systemic approach. Our basic argument is that a dialogic
                  stance can provide important insights into how institutional
                  practices shape the meanings and functions of CSCL tools. A
                  dialogic perspective provides opportunities for making sense
                  of learning and knowledge construction at different levels of
                  activity, while at the same time retaining sensitivity to the

                  virtual environment to immerse children, ages 9–12, in
                  educational tasks. QA combines strategies used in commercial
                  gaming environments with lessons from educational research on
                  learning and motivation. It allows users at participating
                  elementary schools and after-school centers to travel through
                  virtual spaces to perform educational activities, talk with
                  other users and mentors, and build virtual personae. Our work
                  has involved an agenda and process that may be called
                  socially-responsive design, which involves building
                  sociotechnical structures that engage with and potentially
                  transform individuals and their contexts of participation.
                  This work sits at the intersection of education,
                  entertainment, and social commitment and suggests an expansive
                  focus for instructional designers. The focus is on engaging

                  inspire participation consistent with social commitments and

                  of the practice turn in contemporary educational research. In
                  order to make the discussion specific, I use two influential
                  theories, namely activity theory and situated learning theory.
                  They both turn to the notion of practice in order to overcome
                  the limitations of mentalist and structuralist accounts of
                  educational phenomena. Together they represent some of the
                  most influential attempts to transcend the dualistic
                  tendencies of the dominant theoretical paradigms of
                  educational research such as structuralist theories and
                  educational theories that place mind and mental processes at
                  their centre. Activity theory and situated learning theory
                  offer very different accounts of the nature, scope and
                  relevance of institutional, social and material contexts when
                  accounting for the meanings and functions of any particular
                  action or activity. While situated learning theory offers a
                  more internal perspective, activity theory offers a more
                  external perspective on human practices.},

                  course for undergraduate students in which students use
                  three-dimensional (3-D) modeling tools to model the solar
                  system and, in the process, develop rich understandings of
                  astronomical phenomena. Consistent with our participatory
                  pedagogical framework, it was our intention to establish a
                  context that supported students in carrying out scientific
                  inquiry using virtual models they developed. The progression
                  of our thinking and the course curriculum has been grounded in
                  a series of “design experiments,” in which we develop entire
                  courses, do research, and cycle what we are learning into the
                  next iteration of the course. In this manuscript, we use field
                  notes, portions of case studies, interview data, artifact
                  analysis, and excerpts from previous manuscripts to situate
                  the reader in the actual happenings of the course. Focusing
                  primarily on the dynamics of the earth–moon–sun system, we
                  illustrate the modeling process and how learning evolved in
                  this context. In general, we found that 3-D modeling can be
                  used effectively in regular undergraduate university courses
                  as a tool through which students can develop rich
                  understandings of various astronomical phenomena.
                  Additionally, we found the design experiment approach to be a
                  useful strategy for supporting course design that was both
                  theoretically and empirically grounded.},

                  assignments and projects. This study investigates what wikis
                  can do as a means to enhance group interaction, when students
                  are encouraged to participate in constructing text and
                  exchanging peer response. The research focus is on exploring
                  what interaction unfolds in the wiki and how it promotes
                  language learning, from a sociocultural perspective. This
                  interaction is framed both by affordances in the wiki but also
                  by what is expected from students as language learners in an
                  English for Specific Purposes class environment. The analysis
                  has a multilevel approach, focusing on patterns of interaction
                  and the nature of feedback. The study shows that collaboration

                  are numerous contributions relating to both local language and

                  possibilities for the students to evaluate existing
                  contributions and it also provides opportunities for them to
                  suggest constructive changes. In addition, with the
                  environment being web based, we discuss certain benefits
                  arising from the fact that it allows for user-generated

                  itself to encompass a broader range of factors such as the
                  classroom social structures (e.g., beliefs about learning and
                  knowledge, learning activities and participant structures,
                  configurations of both physical space and cyberspace).Although
                  prior research has underscored the importance of classroom

                  and why things work. The Social Infrastructure Framework
                  systematically frames the critical design elements in terms of
                  4 dimensions: (a) cultural beliefs, (b) practices, (c)
                  socio-techno-spatial relations, and (d) interaction with the

                  Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge model of
                  educational practice, the approach conceptualises Web 2.0
                  learning design by relating Anderson and Krathwohl's Taxonomy
                  of Learning, Teaching and Assessing, and different types of
                  constructive and negotiated pedagogies to a range of
                  contemporary Web 2.0-based learning technologies. The learning
                  design process can then be based upon the extent to which
                  different Web 2.0 technologies support the content,
                  pedagogical, modality and synchronicity requirements of the
                  learning tasks. The model is resilient to the emergence of new
                  Web 2.0 tools, as it views technology as only a mediator of
                  pedagogy and content with attributes to fulfil the needs of
                  the learning episode. A range of possible use cases,
                  categorisations and examples are offered to illustrate the

                  padagogischen Wissens und dem Content Knowledge-Modell der
                  Bildungspraxis wurde der Ansatz des Web 2.0 Learning Design im
                  Zusammenhang mit Anderson und Krathwohl's Taxonomie des
                  Lernens, Lehrens und Bewertens konzipiert, und verschiedene

                  facon de conceptualiser et de realiser la conception
                  d'apprentissages reposant sur la Web 2.0. En s'appuyant sur
                  les modeles de pratique educative fondes respectivement sur
                  les connaissances technologiques, les connaissances
                  pedagogiques et les connaissances du contenu, cette approche
                  theorise la conception d'apprentissages de la Web 2.0 en
                  reliant la Taxonomie de l'Apprentissage, l'Enseigner et
                  Evaluer d'Anderson et Krathwohl ainsi que differents types de

                  se baser sur la mesure ou differentes technologies de la Web
                  2.0 repondent aux exigences pedagogiques, de modalite et de
                  synchronicite des taches d'apprentissage. Ce modele resiste a
                  l'emergence de nouveaux outils Web 2.0 du fait qu'il considere
                  la technologie seulement comme une mediatrice de la pedagogie
                  et du contenu avec des attributs servant a repondre aux
                  besoins de tel ou tel episode d'apprentissage. Une gamme de
                  cas d'usages possibles, des categorisations et des exemples
                  sont presentes pour illustrer les concepts et processus de la

                  presente articulo describe una aproximacion a la
                  conceptualizacion y realizacion del diseno de un aprendizaje
                  basado en la Web 2.0. Apoyandose en los modelos de practica
                  educativa fundados en Conocimientos Tecnologicos,
                  Conocimientos Pedagogicos y Conocimientos de Contenidos la
                  presenta aproximacion conceptualiza el diseno de aprendizaje
                  en la Web 2.0 conectando la taxonomia del aprendizaje,
                  ensenanza y evaluacion de Anderson y Krathwohl asi como varios
                  tipos de pedagogias constructivistas y negociadas con una gama
                  de tecnologias de aprendizaje contemporaneas basadas en la Web
                  2.0. El proceso de diseno del aprendizaje puede entonces
                  basarse sobre la medida en que varias metodologias de la Web
                  2.0 satisfacen las exigencias de contenido, pedagogia,
                  modalidad y sincronicidad de las tareas de aprendizaje. El
                  modelo esta resiliente a la emergencia de las nuevas
                  herramientas Web 2.0 en la medida en que se considera la
                  tecnologia solamente como un mediador de tecnologia y
                  contenido con atributos que permiten cumplir con las

                  to seek out professional development opportunities. Librarians
                  owe it to their clients and to themselves as competent
                  professionals, to remain abreast of trends and developments in
                  the field. The purpose of this paper is to address the
                  changing landscape of the library profession, including the
                  changing nature of library and information science education,
                  and to exemplify the importance and necessity of continuing
                  professional development for librarians, the newest
                  manifestation of which is online professional development
                  through Web 2.0 tools and social media technologies.
                  Design/methodology/approach: Specifically, using such
                  technologies enables library professionals to develop an
                  online personal learning network (PLN). Findings: PLNs are
                  beneficial because they are so customizable to an individual's
                  work and research interests and time constraints, and they
                  facilitate global learning and collaboration opportunities
                  that may not otherwise be feasible. In times of financial
                  difficulty, more traditional professional development
                  opportunities requiring travel and funding are often
                  prohibitive; PLNs enable continuous and affordable
                  professional development opportunities that will benefit
                  librarians and their institutions. Originality/value: The
                  paper discusses the newest technologies and opportunities and
                  how their attendant considerations and concerns apply to
                  library professions; also the best ways in which to deliver
                  content and instruct future library professionals. © Emerald

  abstract  = {The rapid adoption of social network sites by teenagers in the
               United States and in many other countries around the world raises
               some important questions. Why do teenagers flock to these sites?
               What are they expressing on them? How do these sites fit into
               their lives? What are they learning from their participation? Are
               these online activities like face-to-face friendships or are they
               different, or complementary? The goal of this chapter is to
               address these questions, and explore their implications for youth
               identities. While particular systems may come and go, how youth
               engage through social network sites today provides long-lasting
               insights into identity formation, status negotiation, and
               peer-to-peer sociality. To address the aforementioned questions,
               I begin by documenting key features of social network sites and
               the business decisions that lead to mass adoption, and then seek
               to situate social network sites in a broader discussion of what I
               call networked publics. I then examine how teens are modeling
               identity through social network profiles so that they can write
               themselves and their community into being. Building on this, I
               investigate how this process of articulated expression supports
               critical peer-based sociality because, by allowing youth to hang
               out amongst their friends and classmates, social network sites
               are providing teens with a space to work out identity and status,
               make sense of cultural cues, and negotiate public life. I argue
               that social network sites are a type of networked public with
               four properties that are not typically present in face-to-face
               public life: persistence, searchability, exact copyability, and
               invisible audiences. These properties fundamentally alter social
               dynamics, complicating the ways in which people interact. I
               conclude by reflecting on the social developments that have
               prompted youth to seek out networked publics, and considering the
               changing role that publics have in young peoples lives.},

                  research interviews in a consumer society. In the first part,
                  an understanding of research interviews as warm, caring, and
                  empowering dialogues is questioned by highlighting power
                  asymmetries in interview relationships. Agonistic interview
                  techniques, which play on contradictions and power
                  differences, are outlined. The second part of the article
                  points to the prevalence of dialogues as exercises of power in
                  politics, management, and education. The third part outlines
                  the interview production of knowledge for consumption in a

                  power dynamics by the social construction of knowledge in

                  use of technology in education, that moves beyond a merely

               saturated with digital media, how does it affect their sense of
               self and others? As they define and redefine their identities
               through engagements with technology, what are the implications
               for their experiences as learners, citizens, consumers, and
               family and community members? This volume addresses the
               consequences of digital media use for young peoples individual
               and social identities. The contributors explore how young people
               use digital media to share ideas and creativity and to
               participate in networks that are small and large, local and
               global, intimate and anonymous. They look at the emergence of new
               genres and forms, from SMS and instant messaging to home pages,
               blogs, and social networking sites. They discuss such topics as
               "girl power" online, the generational digital divide, young
               people and mobile communication, and the appeal of the "digital
               publics" of MySpace, considering whether these media offer young
               people genuinely new forms of engagement, interaction, and
               communication. Contributors: Angela Booker, danah boyd, Kirsten

                  fundamentally from the way in which teachers view education.
                  These different out- looks are (partly) a consequence of the
                  different work roles of researchers and teachers. This article
                  explores the question of whether it is really inevitable that
                  research and practice each estab- lish different views of

                  of researchers draws heavily on a dualistic view that
                  separates knowledge from skill and detaches human intellectual
                  fac- ulties from other human faculties. Although such
                  dualistic notions are highly contested nowadays, they are
                  institutionalized in the definition of the work of researchers
                  and the purpose of research. The contri- bution of this
                  article lies in the presentation of a unifying framework in
                  which the views of teachers and researchers can be (at least
                  partially) reconciled in the context of clinical research

                  with similar interests or learning foci across levels and
                  programs. This form of learning support builds on and

               collect data from a popular system and investigate the

               stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of
               collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to
               the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity;
               (ii) a notion of memory - or aging of resources - in the form of
               a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system.
               Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively
               for the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high
               accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of
               users, who - despite the complexity of their own cognitive
               processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their

                  supply of knowledge, namely the willingness to share knowledge
                  with other members. This paper integrates the Social Cognitive
                  Theory and the Social Capital Theory to construct a model for
                  investigating the motivations behind people's knowledge
                  sharing in virtual communities. The study holds that the
                  facets of social capital — social interaction ties, trust,
                  norm of reciprocity, identification, shared vision and shared
                  language — will influence individuals' knowledge sharing in
                  virtual communities. We also argue that outcome expectations —
                  community-related outcome expectations and personal outcome
                  expectations — can engender knowledge sharing in virtual
                  communities. Data collected from 310 members of one
                  professional virtual community provide support for the
                  proposed model. The results help in identifying the motivation
                  underlying individuals' knowledge sharing behavior in

                  educational models, namely, the thematic approach, meaningful
                  learning, concept maps, and the spiral curriculum. Based on a
                  thematic approach, a new way is proposed to select the
                  contents that will be explored in the educational process. We
                  emphasize the beneﬁts of a thematic approach in students’
                  motivation. After contents are chosen, we propose the use of
                  the directives of meaningful learning and concept maps, as a
                  method and as a tool, respectively, to organize knowledge

                  validity of concept mapping, a computer-based concept mapping
                  system has been developed. The system provides two learning
                  environments. In the ‘construct-by-self’ environment, the
                  system provides students with the evaluation results and
                  corresponding hints for feedback. The students construct
                  concept maps by themselves with only the assistance of the
                  feedback. In the ‘construct-onscaffold’ environment, in
                  addition to the feedback, the students receive an incomplete
                  concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as

  abstract  = {Impelled by a demand for increasing American strength in the new
               global economy, many educators, public officials, business
               leaders, and parents argue that school computers and Internet
               access will improve academic learning and prepare students for an
               information-based workplace. But just how valid is this argument?
               In "Oversold and Underused," one of the most respected voices in
               American education argues that when teachers are not given a say
               in how the technology might reshape schools, computers are merely
               souped-up typewriters and classrooms continue to run much as they
               did a generation ago. In his studies of early childhood, high
               school, and university classrooms in Silicon Valley, Larry Cuban
               found that students and teachers use the new technologies far
               less in the classroom than they do at home, and that teachers who
               use computers for instruction do so infrequently and
               unimaginatively. Cuban points out that historical and
               organizational economic contexts influence how teachers use
               technical innovations. Computers can be useful when teachers
               sufficiently understand the technology themselves, believe it
               will enhance learning, and have the power to shape their own
               curricula. But these conditions can't be met without a broader
               and deeper commitment to public education beyond preparing
               workers. More attention, Cuban says, needs to be paid to the
               civic and social goals of schooling, goals that make the question
               of how many computers are in classrooms trivial.}

                  instructional, curricular, and governance planned changes that
                  have returned more than once. To answer the question, I first
                  examine the dominant explanation presented by researchers and
                  policymakers: the lack of rationality in proposing and
                  implementing planned change. I explore why the dominant
                  explanation is flawed in its frequently used metaphors and
                  analysis. I then offer alternative explanations for recurring
                  reforms–a political and an institutional perspective harnessed
                  together–to explain the puzzle of why reforms return. The
                  point of this analysis is to enlarge the repertoire of
                  explanations that researchers and policymakers use to examine
                  potential and past reforms. The policymaking stakes run high
                  for expanding the range of explanations because the questions
                  of why reforms failed in the past and why they return go to
                  the heart of present policy debates over whether federal,
                  state, and district mandates to alter schooling will get past

                  evolutionarily novel abilities and knowledge needed to
                  function as adults in modern societies. Evolutionary
                  educational psychology is the study of how an evolved bias in
                  children’s learning and motivational systems influences their
                  ability and motivation to learn evolutionarily novel academic
                  abilities and information in school. I provide an overview of
                  evolved domains of mind, corresponding learning and
                  motivational biases, and the evolved systems that allow humans
                  to learn about and cope with variation and change within
                  lifetimes. The latter enable the creation of cultural and
                  academic innovations and support the learning of

  abstract     = {Science Created by You (SCY) is a project on learning in
                  science and technology domains. SCY uses a pedagogical
                  approach that centres around products, called 'emerging
                  learning objects- (ELOs) that are created by students.
                  Students work individually and collaboratively in SCY-Lab (the
                  general SCY learning environment) on 'missions' that are
                  guided by socio-scientific questions (for example 'How can we
                  design a CO2-friendly house?'). Fulfilling SCY missions
                  requires a combination of knowledge from different content
                  areas (eg, physics, mathematics, biology, as well as social
                  sciences). While on a SCY mission, students perform several
                  types of learning activities that can be characterised as
                  productive processes (experiment, game, share, explain,
                  design, etc), they encounter multiple resources, collaborate
                  with varying coalitions of peers and use changing
                  constellations of tools and scaffolds. The configuration of
                  SCY-Lab is adaptive to the actual learning situation and may
                  provide advice to students on appropriate learning activities,
                  resources, tools and scaffolds, or peer students who can
                  support the learning process. The SCY project aims at students
                  between 12 and 18 years old. In the course of the project, a
                  total of four SCY missions will be developed, of which one is
                  currently available. © 2010 Becta. Published by Blackwell

                  must be considered. Importantly, many of these barriers

                  important starting point in understanding the change process

                  ICT-based resource (a Virtual Chemistry Laboratory) into some
                  science teachers' practice within the Irish education system.
                  From these experiences a working framework has been developed
                  to describe teachers' level of ICT integration into their
                  practice and the factors underpinning this. The framework
                  raises important questions of how teachers may be effectively
                  supported to move between descriptions within the framework.
                  It also highlights the need for change attempts to incorporate
                  mixed strategies for mixed teacher stances on ICT integration.

                  offer some provocations for researchers setting out to engage
                  sympathetically with online culture, to account for the
                  particular kinds of intimacy these spaces enable. Each online
                  scene or space, whether declared to be a community or not, is
                  organised both by its specific form and by an order of
                  appropriate identity practices associated with that form. At

                  belonging mediate these practices which are recognisable

                  inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept
                  of expansive learning are examined with the help of four
                  questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they
                  learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five
                  central principles of activity theory are presented, namely
                  activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of
                  activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving
                  force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible

                  article argues for a complexity of content, context, and
                  method in understanding current problems. Focusing on a model
                  of learning which includes dialogical and reflective
                  approaches, the final part of the article reports on aspect of
                  the authors' experimental practice with role‐play for dealing
                  with complex issues. The review of the literature and our
                  experience of action–research introduce a view of education
                  which promotes young people's awareness of multiple points of
                  view, an ability to establish relationships between processes,
                  scales, and contexts which may be nonlinearly related, and
                  practice with creative and nonviolent forms of interrelations
                  with others. Such an approach in science education is coherent
                  with a scenario of planet sustainability based on ecological
                  webs and equity principles. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci

                  distinguishes bctwccn two opposite approaches to the
                  acquisition of cxpertisc: “an ‘algorithmic model, ’ in which

                  the form of a rccipc. and an ‘enculturational in model.’ whcrc
                  the process has more to do with unconscious social contagion.”
                  The former approach may bc charactcrizcd as top-down, the
                  latter as bottom-up. Mainstream cxpcrimcntal cognitive scicncc
                  and cognitive psychology has consistently rcprcscnted the
                  former approach (c.g., Chi, Glaser SL Farr, 1988;
                  Ericsson\&Smith, 1091; Hoffman, 1092). Rcscarchcrs inspired by
                  philosophers such as Hcidcggcr, Polanyi and the late
                  Wittgcnstcin have argued for the latter approach (e.g.,
                  Drcyfus fir Dreyfus, 1986; Goranzon \& Joscfson, 1988; Nyiri
                  \& Smith, 1988). Both thcsc approaches share a vertical view
                  of expcrtisc. Characteristic to both is ;I discourse of
                  “stages” or “lcvcls” of knowlcdgc and skill. Such a vertical
                  image assumes a uniform, singular model of what counts as an
                  “expert” in a given field. It is not accidental that such a
                  well-bounded domain as chess, with its rigorous universal
                  ranking system, has persistently served as the favorite
                  example of expertise for both approaches. In this paper, we
                  argue for a broader, multi-dimensional view of expertise.
                  While the vertical dimension remains important, a horizontal
                  dimension is rapidly becoming increasingly relevant for the
                  understanding and acquisition of expertise. In their work,
                  experts operate in and move between multiple parallel activity
                  contexts. These multiple contexts demand and afford different,
                  complementary but also conflicting cognitive tools, rules, and
                  patterns of social interaction. The criteria of expert
                  knowledge and skill arc different in the various contexts.
                  Experts face the challenge of negotiating and combining
                  ingredients from different contexts to achieve hybrid
                  solutions. The vertical master-novice expertise. is
                  problematizcd as demands for dialogical problem solving
                  increase. Two central features of this newly emerging
                  landscape of expertise may be designated as polycontextuality
                  Y. ENCESTRGM er al. and boundary crossing. We will first
                  discuss these two concepts theoretically. We will then analyze
                  three cases of collaborative problem solving and learning in
                  team environments. The three cases are based on recordings and
                  observations conducted in 1993 and 1994 in a municipal welfare
                  and health center, a primary school, and a factory which
                  manufactures cabins for large ships, all located in Finland.
                  The cases allow us to examine both the difficulties and the
                  potential of various types of polycontextuality and boundary
                  crossing. Finally, we will discuss the implications of our
                  analyses for understanding expert cognition.},

                  as a technique for investigating how people approach
                  interactions in a number of different situations. In general,
                  the technique I describe involves interviewing individuals by
                  playing them audio or audiovisual recordings of their own
                  behavior in social situations and discussing different aspects
                  of those recorded interactions. Doing so can help us to
                  understand what signals interactants understand as important,
                  what signals they try to convey to others, and how they choose
                  from various options to act upon the information they receive
                  in interactions. Using the example of jazz jam sessions, I ask
                  why it is that interactions can sometimes go smoothly and
                  uneventfully, or sometimes break down completely. The
                  stimulated recall interviews provide a valuable tool in
                  helping the ethnographer to answer these kinds of questions.},

                  learning, but these technologies support only episodic
                  learning. Equally important are those technologies that
                  provide a context for these learning episodes, an environment
                  where students interact and converse among themselves. This
                  paper describes experimentation in the development of
                  distributed online courses and in software particularly, the
                  personal learning environment - that support the formation of
                  connections between the far-flung pieces of such courses. This
                  work, in turn, is suggesting and supporting the model of
                  learning described in the first section, that of a course
                  network supporting and informing an ever-shifting set of
                  course episodes. This in turn suggests a pedagogy of
                  participation rather than retention, and even suggests
                  distributed and locally-based forms of evaluation and
                  assessment. Future developments will focus on realizing these
                  concepts as software or at least software prototypes. The

                  interaction around episodic learning events in a distributed
                  environment, transforming them from elements in a linear

                  computer-based environments in which students learn about
                  science topics in the context of addressing a socio-scientific
                  problem. Along their way to a solution for this problem
                  students produce many types of intermediate products or
                  learning objects. SCY learning environments center the entire
                  learning process around creating, sharing, discussing, and
                  re-using these learning objects. This instructional approach
                  requires dedicated instructional designs, which are supplied
                  in the form of what are called pedagogical scenarios. A SCY
                  pedagogical scenario presents the learning process as an
                  organized assembly of elementary learning processes, each
                  associated with a specific learning object and a tool for
                  creating this learning object. Designing a SCY learning
                  environment is basically a two-step procedure: the first step
                  is to select one of the available scenarios, and the second
                  step is to define the domain content. The SCY technical
                  infrastructure then handles the instantiation of the scenario
                  as a SCY computer-based learning environment. In this article
                  we describe the SCY pedagogical design scenarios and report on

                  range of media at their disposal for conducting fieldwork, for
                  aiding analysis and, most challengingly, for representing
                  their completed work. These include digital media such as
                  photographs, video film, audio-recordings, graphics and others
                  besides. Through the computer ‘writing space’, these media can
                  be integrated together, alongside more conventional written
                  interpretation, into hypermedia environments. However,
                  integration poses a number of potential problems, which this
                  article addresses through a discussion of the semiotics of
                  multimedia. In particular, it argues that different media can
                  be seen to ‘afford’ different kinds of meaning. The
                  integration of different media, therefore, has potentially
                  significant implications for ethnography. Rather than seeing
                  these media forms as discrete, we suggest an approach to
                  ethnographic work which sees meaning as emerging from the
                  fusion of differently mediated forms into new,
                  ‘multi-semiotic’ modes. We therefore recognize the need to go
                  beyond the current interest in visual methods, and instead to
                  develop ways of understanding what kinds of meanings are
                  produced in multimodal ethnographic work.},

                  overview from within the framework of computer-mediated
                  communication (CMC) of concerns and paradigmatic failures of
                  trust in the history of online communication. I turn to the
                  more directly philosophical analyses of trust online by first
                  offering an introductory taxonomy of diverse accounts of trust
                  that have emerged over the past decade or so. In the face of
                  important objections to the possibility of establishing and
                  fostering trust in online environments—objections that emerge
                  especially from the perspective of virtue ethics and
                  phenomenological approaches to how we know and navigate the
                  world as embodied beings—I then take up three major arguments
                  in recent work in favor of the possibilities of trust online,
                  followed by three vicious circles that run counter to more
                  optimistic views. I close with a summary of some additional
                  reasons for optimism regarding trust online, followed by a
                  final question that emerges out of recent CMC research on
                  social networking sites that poses, I argue, fundamental
                  challenges indeed to how we understand and may foster and
                  experience trust online.},

  abstract     = {The paper examines studies based on the theory of expansive
                  learning, formulated in 1987. In recent years the theory has
                  been used in a wide variety of studies and interventions. The
                  theory builds on foundational ideas put forward by Vygotsky,
                  Leont'ev, Il'enkov, and Davydov, key figures in the Russian
                  school of cultural-historical activity theory. Studies based
                  on the theory are reviewed in six sections: expansive learning
                  as transformation of the object, expansive learning as
                  movement in the zone of proximal development, expansive
                  learning as cycles of learning actions, expansive learning as
                  boundary crossing and network building, expansive learning as
                  distributed and discontinuous movement, and formative
                  interventions. A separate section is devoted to critiques of
                  expansive learning. It is concluded that the ultimate test of
                  learning theories is how they help practitioners to generate
                  learning that grasps pressing issues the humankind is facing.
                  The theory of expansive learning currently expands its
                  analyses both up and down, outward and inward. Moving up and
                  outward, it tackles learning in fields or networks of
                  interconnected activity systems with their partially shared
                  and often contested objects. Moving down and inward, it
                  tackles issues of subjectivity, experiencing, personal sense,
                  emotion, embodiment, identity, and moral commitment. © 2010

  abstract  = {So-called “design experiments” have been presented as a radical
               alternative to traditional experimental designs in behavioral
               sciences. A closer scrutiny of design experiments shows that they
               share the basic linear methodology of traditional randomized
               controlled trials, and thus ignore resistance and agency of
               learners as a source of surprise and novelty. Formative
               interventions based on Vygotsky’s principle of double stimulation
               offer an alternative that builds on and purposefully fosters
               learners’ agency. Formative interventions may be characterized
               with the help of an argumentative grammar which proposes (a) the
               collective activity system as a unit of analysis, (b)
               contradictions as a source of change and development, (c) agency
               as a crucial layer of causality, and (d) transformation of
               practice as a form of expansive concept formation. These four
               epistemic tenets are concretized with the help of analysis of
               data from a Change Laboratory formative experiment conducted in a
               Finnish hospital. The analysis shows that double stimulation is a
               multi-layered and longitudinal process in which both the initial
               problem situation (first stimulus) and the mediating conceptual
               tool (second stimulus) are reformulated and enriched in
               successive steps. Such a process of double stimulation generates
               a thirdness, a new concept for the activity under transformation.}

  abstract     = {A global information ethics that seeks to avoid imperialistic
                  homogenization must conjoin shared norms while simultaneously
                  preserving the irreducible differences between cultures and
                  peoples. I argue that a global information ethics may fulfill
                  these requirements by taking up an ethical pluralism –
                  specifically Aristotle's pros hen [‘‘towards one’’] or
                  ‘‘focal’’ equivocals. These ethical pluralisms figure
                  centrally in both classical and contemporary Western ethics:
                  they further offer important connections with the major
                  Eastern ethical tradition of Confucian thought. Both
                  traditions understand ethical judgment to lead to and thus
                  require ethical pluralism – i.e., an acceptance of more than
                  one judgment regarding the interpretation and application of a
                  shared ethical norm. Both traditions invoke notions of
                  resonance and harmony to articulate pluralistic structures of
                  connection alongside irreducible differences. Specific
                  examples withinWestern computer and information ethics
                  demonstrate these pluralisms in fact working in praxis. After
                  reviewing further resonances and radical differences between
                  Western and Eastern views, I then argue that emerging
                  conceptions of privacy and data privacy protection laws in
                  China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Thailand in fact constitute a
                  robust, pros hen pluralism withWestern conceptions. In both
                  theory and in praxis, then, this pluralism thus fulfills the
                  requirement for a global information ethics that holds shared
                  norms alongside the irreducible differences between cultures
                  and peoples.},

                  yet have not begun to account for widespread knowledge sharing
                  in more native, unstructured group settings found in online
                  games and virtual worlds. In this paper, we describe and
                  analyze how an insider gaming practice spread across a group
                  of tween players ages 9–12 years in an after-school gaming
                  club that simultaneously participated in a virtual world
                  called Whyville.net. In order to understand how this practice
                  proliferated, we followed the club members as they interacted
                  with each other and members of the virtual world at large.
                  Employing connective ethnography to trace the movements in
                  learning and teaching this practice, we coordinated data
                  records from videos, tracking data, field notes, and
                  interviews. We found that club members took advantage of the
                  different spaces, people, and times available to them across
                  Whyville, the club, and even home and classroom spaces. By
                  using an insider gaming practice, namely teleporting, rather
                  than the more traditional individual person as our analytical
                  lens, we were able to examine knowledge sharing and diffusion
                  across the gaming spaces, including events in local small
                  groups as well as encounters in the virtual world. In the

                  dialogism to artic- ulate what it means to understand a
                  scientific idea. In science, understanding an idea is both
                  conceptual and epistemic and is exhibited by an ability to use
                  it in explanation and argumentation. Some distillation of
                  these activities implies that dialogic understanding of a
                  scientific idea includes being able to use it to explain
                  natural phenomena, being aware that it is one among a
                  multiplicity of alternatives, and that the scientific idea is
                  superior to alternatives based upon a scientific evaluation
                  which involves relating it to evidence. This notion of
                  dialogic understanding is related here to a scaffolding
                  framework, which we argue characterizes one form of
                  instructional support for framing content dialogically as part
                  of explanation and argumentation. For illustration, the
                  framework is applied to data from a high school evolutionary
                  biology course. In contrast to the prevailing position that
                  dialogic understanding should be supported through engaging in
                  argumentation (i.e., actual dialogue), we entertain an
                  additional possibility that dialogic understanding can be
                  supported through dialogic framing.We also entertain the
                  possibility that dialogic framing of content can provide
                  initial support for student engagement in argumentation.},

                  interplay, through live and digital drama, of local-global
                  knowledge about student engagement, is a study of youth and
                  teachers in drama classrooms in contexts of schooling marked
                  as ‘disadvantaged’ in research sites in Toronto (Canada),
                  Lucknow (India), Taipei (Taiwan) and Boston (USA). The authors
                  first outline the place of digital methods in the research,
                  describing how software such as Adobe Connect and Survey
                  Monkey, as well as a project Wiki and blog, enabled some
                  virtual communication among and within research sites. They go
                  on to suggest that their experience with these methods exposed
                  the significant limitations of the technology, but also that
                  coming up against these limitations posed useful questions
                  about the nature of specific research methods and about the
                  overall priorities of the study. As an example, the article
                  focuses on how digital methods have usefully complicated
                  available conceptions of ‘liveness’, an important dimension
                  both of live performance and of ethnographic fieldwork.
                  Despite their skepticism about the promise of new

                  Central to the study introduced here is a model of community
                  inquiry that constitutes three elements essential to an
                  educational transaction—cognitive presence, social presence,
                  and teaching presence. Indicators (key words/phrases) for each
                  of the three elements emerged from the analysis of
                  computer-conferencing transcripts. The indicators described
                  represent a template or tool for researchers to analyze
                  written transcripts, as well as a guide to educators for the

                  interaction studies, the feasibility of generic claims in

                  follows a trajectory, a Freytag Pyramid—perhaps the line of a
                  human life or the stages of the hero’s journey. A story is
                  told by one person or by a creative team to an audience that
                  is usually quiet, even receptive. Or at least that’s what a
                  story used to be, and that’s how a story used to be told.
                  Today, with digital networks and social media, this pattern is
                  changing. Stories now are open-ended, branching, hyperlinked,
                  cross-media, participatory, exploratory, and unpre- dictable.
                  And they are told in new ways: Web 2.0 storytelling picks up
                  these new types of stories and runs with them, accelerating

                  The final analysis revealed two main themes of narration,
                  which guided the further descriptions. The first theme,

                  way information is distributed and organized through the world
                  wide web (www). We suggest that these three "innovations" can
                  be brought together to offer a better understanding of the way
                  the human mind works. The internet and the information
                  revolution may finally offer the opportunity to use and
                  develop inductive learning practices and information based
                  social inquiry in ways Pragmatic philosophers envisioned a
                  hundred years ago, while the recent rise of connectionist and
                  cognitive architecture works provides a concrete context for
                  such developments. This confluence of process represents the
                  type of synergy that only history can offer. The information
                  revolution-exemplified by both the rise of connectionism and

                  methodological framework for the identification and analysis
                  of different types of discursive manifestations of
                  contradictions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is
                  based on the dialectical tradition of cultural-historical
                  activity theory. The methodological framework is developed by
                  means of analyzing the entire transcribed corpus of the
                  discourse conducted in a change laboratory intervention
                  consisting of eight sessions and altogether 189,398 words.
                  Findings – Four types of discursive manifestations, namely
                  dilemmas, conflicts, critical conflicts, and double binds,
                  could be effectively identified in the data. Specific
                  linguistic cues were a useful first level of approaching the
                  different types of manifestations. Critical conflicts and
                  double binds were found to be particularly effective lenses on
                  systemic contradictions. Research limitations/implications –
                  The paper points to the need for theoretical and conceptual
                  rigor in studies using the notion of contradiction. Further
                  empirical testing of the framework is needed and may lead to
                  more refined or alternative categories. Practical implications
                  – Dynamics of different organizational change interventions
                  may be effectively analyzed and compared with the help of the
                  framework. Originality/value – The paper presents an original,
                  empirically-tested methodological framework that may be a
                  valuable resource for analyzes of contradictions driving
                  organizational change. Keywords Intervention, Organizational

                  with less skilled girls. In cross-sex games, the girls
                  reorganized their participation to playfully challenge the
                  boys' (physical) domination. The girls shifted behaviors as
                  the configuration of players changed across game contexts to
                  realize multiple, contradictory, and shifting (moral) stances
                  (ranging from a "morality of rights," to a "morality of
                  responsibility" and a "morality of play"). Overall, the
                  findings challenge a unitary (and separate) view of feminine
                  morality and suggest that research on gender and morality
                  should be grounded in detailed analyses of interactions across
                  (game) contexts.},

                  users, the SBS provide users with the necessary tools to

                  article presents a description, analysis, and comparison of
                  different SBS, which are catego- rized as web applications

                  emphasized are the advantages for learning and collaborative

                  specifically studied for its contribution as a metacognitive
                  tool. Diigo shows the way each user learns, thinks, and
                  develops the knowledge that was obtained from the information

                communicating, and collaborating is media-dependent: tools,
                materials, and social arrangements have always been involved in
                defining and conceptualizing these activities. Historically the
                emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance
                scholars”. In today’s world, most of the significant problems
                are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual
                human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty
                discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only
                “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which
                stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate.
                Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning \& Design (L3D)
                over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new
                understanding of learning, new media, and new learning
                organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the
                dialectical relationship between:  how a deep understanding of
                learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for
                future generations of socio-technical environments;  how the
                unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms
                learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and
                “technology-centered” approaches; and  how new learning
                organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing
                learning and education in the 21st century. This paper describes
                conceptual frameworks and socio-technical environments to

                  between perspectives. It is indispensable for understanding
                  human social behaviour. While theoretical work on
                  intersubjectivity is relatively sophisticated, methodological
                  approaches to studying intersubjectivity lag behind. Most
                  methodologies assume that individuals are the unit of
                  analysis. In order to research intersubjectivity, however,
                  methodologies are needed that take relationships as the unit
                  of analysis. The first aim of this article is to review
                  existing methodologies for studying intersubjectivity. Four
                  methodological approaches are reviewed: comparative
                  self‐report, observing behaviour, analysing talk and
                  ethnographic engagement. The second aim of the article is to
                  introduce and contribute to the development of a dialogical
                  method of analysis. The dialogical approach enables the study
                  of intersubjectivity at different levels, as both implicit and
                  explicit, and both within and between individuals and groups.
                  The article concludes with suggestions for using the proposed
                  method for researching intersubjectivity both within

                  classrooms. Such shifts have affected constructs of learning
                  and instruction, and paths for future research. This article

                  how Web 2.0’s unique capabilities and youth’s proclivities in
                  using it influence learning and teaching. Two important

                  as blogs and wikis have the potential to dramatically change
                  education, both in how we conceptualize and operationalize
                  processes and strategies. We argue in this paper that it is a
                  change that has been over a century in coming. The promise of
                  the Web 2.0 is similar to ideas proposed by Pragmatists such
                  as Charles Peirce and John Dewey. Peirce proposed the logic of
                  abduction as critical for the types of unique/progressive
                  thinking that leads to creative problem solving and/or
                  discovery. While logic based in deduction offers outcomes with
                  certainty, logic based in abduction offers potentially
                  valuable insights. Dewey tried to implement progressive
                  education in the classrooms. Dewey’s ideas, while influential,
                  were often misunderstood, or considered too idealistic and/or
                  unworkable in the traditional classrooms. Logics based in
                  abduction required that different major premises and
                  hypotheses for problem solving be held simultaneously and over
                  time. This type of scenario is often times difficult if not
                  impossible in education based on direct interactions.
                  Hypertext, especially as capture through emerging tools of Web
                  2.0, may offer the technologies that enable the type of
                  information based networks within the education process that
                  promote abduction and the democratic classroom as Dewey
                  envisioned.},

                  outcomes of learning through networks were conducted. The
                  article concludes that seven factors play a pivotal role in
                  professional learning through networks: sharing, motivation,
                  perceived value of the network, feedback, personal learning,
                  trust and support, peer characteristics and peer value. Also,
                  different perspectives, motivation, social media and
                  collaboration, reciprocity, intrinsic motivation, innovation,
                  status and reputation and networking strategies play an
                  important role in motivation. Future work should focus on
                  investigating the interplay between factors that influence
                  networked learning identified in this article},

  title    = {{ICT} and learning in teacher education The social construction of
              pedagogical {ICT} discourse and design},
  author   = {Granberg, Carina},
  pages    = {1--52},

  abstract = {Background In recent decades, system-wide policies and substantial
              resources have been directed towards enhancing the use of ICT in
              learning contexts. This development can be observed at
              international and national levels. However, reports have indicated
              a ’slow uptake’ of the use of ICT for pedagogical purposes among
              compulsory schools and teacher education institutions. Although
              the teacher education at Umeå University follows this pattern,
              there have been several initiatives in using ICT for learning in
              the teacher education programmes. The aim of this study is to
              scrutinise the process in which ICT-supported methods for learning
              have been introduced, used and disseminated throughout teacher
              education. Methods Three ICT-supported methods for teaching and
              learning were chosen for this study: digital individual
              development planning (IUP), blogs and e-portfolios. To capture
              teachers’ and students’ experiences of introducing the pedagogical
              use of ICT, 115 interviews were conducted and four questionnaires
              were administered over a four-year period (2006-2010). Course
              documents and observations of blogs and e-portfolios supplied
              additional data. Hermeneutics was chosen as the methodological
              approach. Thematic content analysis was carried out in the first
              three part-studies, and theoretical frameworks suited for the
              identified themes were chosen for the analyses. Since pedagogical
              discourses appeared to be important, discourse analysis was used
              in the fourth part-study. A final meta analysis has been carried
              out and is presented later in this thesis. Results In Umeå, as in
              other countries, teacher education has been slow to adopt ICT for
              learning. Still, the use of ICT for learning has increased over
              time. ICT-supported methods such as IUP, blogs and e-portfolios
              have found their way into the context through a
              recontextualisation process in which ICT discourses and designs
              are socially constructed. However, the recontextualisation process
              could merely be found within sub-fields, such as teacher teams and
              project groups, since in the main-field (i.e. teacher education)
              traditional ways of teaching and learning have been internalised.
              These traditions hold symbolic capital, and teachers who have the
              means to do so will act according to their habitus and defend the
              traditions. The recontextualisation process will therefore be kept
              within the sub-fields, and the dissemination will be limited.
              Furthermore, the sub-fields are rather isolated from one another,
              and therefore pedagogical ICT discourses and designs are created
              in varied ways. However, none of them could be regarded as
              internalised, and the social construction of pedagogical ICT
              discourse and design has to be considered to be still ‘under
              construction’. 5}

                  Folksonomies are an emergent phenomenon of the social Web.
                  They arise from data about how people associate terms with
                  content that they generate, share, or consume. Recently the
                  two ideas have been put into opposition, as if they were right
                  and left poles of a political spectrum. This is a false
                  dichotomy; they are more like apples and oranges. In fact, as
                  the Semantic Web matures and the social Web grows, there is
                  increasing value in applying Semantic Web technologies to the

                  students' 1:1 laptop use from a capability perspective by
                  investigating increases and decreases of students'
                  opportunities and choices. The paper investigates changes that
                  have taken place and how these changes enable or restrict
                  students to do and be what they desire.
                  Design/methodology/approach: The paper undertakes an
                  interpretive case study based on group interviews and
                  questionnaires. Sen's capability approach is used as
                  theoretical framework and has informed the data collection and
                  the analysis. Findings: 1:1 laptops in schools have provided
                  students with new opportunities and choices, but also
                  restricted others. An evident opportunity is the equalization
                  of access to computers. Other opportunities relate to
                  schoolwork efficiency and increased access to information.
                  Gains also include the use of different media for overcoming
                  disabilities or to fit individual learning styles. Regarding
                  students' well-being, a "fun" learning environment is
                  mentioned. However, the "fun" is often about playing games or
                  using social media - something which diverts the students'
                  attention from the learning. Students also find that they are
                  less social, too computer dependent, and that they miss using
                  pen and paper. Additionally, health issues such as back
                  problems and headaches are reported, as well as an increased
                  risk of being robbed. Originality/value: Most research on 1:1
                  laptops in education focuses on easily quantifiable measures
                  and reports from a teacher perspective. The paper takes a
                  broader approach and investigates the impact 1:1 laptops have
                  on students' well-being and agency. © Emerald Group Publishing

                  inquiry that exhibits an essential principal feature of mature
                  scientific inquiry: namely, engagement in increasingly deep
                  levels of explanation. Technical infrastructure for the study

                  and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or
                  negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about
                  learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies
                  have systematically investigated its meaning. This article
                  provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the
                  evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement.
                  This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major
                  influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can
                  be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then
                  proposed that identifies the particular properties and
                  circumstances that make it effective, and some typically
                  thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback
                  and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally,
                  this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be
                  used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms. (PsycINFO

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the concept of Open Source Intelligence
                  (OSINT) as an important component for understanding human
                  problem solving in the 21st century. OSINT is in many ways the
                  result of changing human–information relationships resulting
                  from the emergence and growing dominance of the Internet and
                  the World Wide Web in everyday life. This paper suggests that
                  the Internet/Web changes the dynamic relationship between what
                  Cattell and Horn have identiﬁed as the two general factors of
                  human intelligence: crystallized intelligence and ﬂuid
                  intelligence. The Internet/Web open up new possibilities for
                  accessing information and transcending over-determined
                  cultural intelligence in problem solving. This offers ﬂuid
                  intelligence, which often trails off in adulthood, a new
                  vitality across the lifespan. But the diminishment of
                  crystallized intelligence, and especially cultural
                  intelligence, also presents a number of important problems in
                  maintenance of cohesive, social cooperatives. The development
                  of OSINT (using tools and ethos created by the Open Source
                  movement of the last few decades) offers both a framework for
                  reaching beyond the boundaries of traditional cultural
                  intelligence and ways to create cooperative, open, problem
                  solving communities. The Internet/Web will continue to create
                  confusion and fear as we move deeper into this new age, but
                  also presents extraordinary possibilities for augmenting human
                  intellect if we can understand it and learn to harness its
                  potential.},

                  Dialogical concept mapping is about facilitating and recording
                  the outcomes of the cognitive processes that leads to personal
                  understanding. The method enables individual construction, and
                  its essence is best conveyed by thinking about the
                  relationship between an architect and a series of drafts or
                  designs. The process of surfacing and concretizing
                  representation invariably alters the nature of internal
                  understanding. The approach is learner-centered and
                  necessarily begins with the individual attempting to
                  externalize their personal understandings however tentative
                  these may be. The most striking potential of dialogical
                  concept mapping is that it enables teachers to look into their
                  students' learning process. Dialogical concept mapping makes
                  the workings visible and enables feedback anchored in a
                  concrete record of learning process rather than its finished
                  products.},

                  social indexing process, since users share their tags and
                  resources, constructing a social tag index, so-called

                  areas of improvement to the curriculum prior to a planned
                  second implementation. The course was designed around problems
                  that students work in small teams to solve under the guidance
                  of facilitators, with early sequence problems designed to
                  foster the problem-solving skills required to succeed in the
                  course. This report describes students’ impressions of and

                  information. When users search for information or products on
                  the Web, they will presumably be inclined to choose their path
                  of navigation on the basis of their prior knowledge. In those
                  cases in which the prior knowledge of users is incorrect,
                  however, this navigation process is assumed to lead to
                  suboptimal search results. In an experimental study with 180
                  participants, we examined to what extent both the users’ prior
                  knowledge and social tags – which capture the collective
                  knowledge of a Web community in tag clouds – inﬂuenced the
                  navigation of users and triggered incidental learning
                  processes during the Web search. The results supported the
                  assumption that the users’ prior knowledge is indeed crucial
                  for navigation, as users followed those tags which
                  corresponded to their internal associations. Moreover, we
                  found that social tags also affected the navigation behavior
                  of users, as a strong collective association of social tags
                  led to a high selection rate for these tags. Finally, the
                  results showed that social tags triggered incidental learning
                  processes, as those internal associations which corresponded
                  to tags with a strong collective association were strengthened
                  during navigation. The implications of these ﬁndings for

                  11-year-old children, collaborating within a
                  computer-supported classroom, learned an explanation-driven
                  process of inquiry that had characteristics of the progressive
                  nature of scientific inquiry. The technical infrastructure for
                  the study was provided by the Computer-Supported Intentional
                  Learning Environments ({CSILE).} The study was based on
                  qualitative content analysis of students' written productions
                  in physics posted to {CSILE's} database in three investigative
                  projects. The study indicated that some young students do
                  engage in epistemic agency and genuinely pursue
                  explanation-driven inquiry. students' intuitive explanations
                  were often functional (referring to human agency) and
                  empirical (in terms of observables) in nature. Provided that
                  understandable explanations were available, some of the
                  students moved towards theoretical scientific explanations.

                  studying individual creativity in isolation, we have developed
                  a conceptual framework of creativity in the context of
                  everyday practice - where design activities prevail and
                  learning is constantly required. The conceptual framework
                  explores new role distributions between people and computers
                  based on theories that view design as reflection-in-action and
                  breakdowns as opportunities for learning and creativity. We
                  use an example from the domain of multimedia information
                  design to illustrate how creativity is supported by
                  domain-oriented design environments. The paper describes the

               learning with the techniques, methods, and analytical perspective
               of ethnography. Distributed collaborative learning is commonly
               placed in hybrid settings, where the participants engage in
               computer-mediated communication as part of some sort of
               institutionalised education. There are thus some inherent issues,
               both new and old, that need to be taken into consideration when
               doing ethnography in distributed learning environments.
               Addressing these issues, we emphasise the role of technology and
               information infrastructure and how this might impact the learning
               situation, but also how it can be used as a resource in the
               ethnographic research. In addition, we discuss how to observe,
               participate and immerse oneself in these technologically dense
               environments. The ideas and methodological issues are illustrated
               by presenting empirical examples from and experiences made in one
               of our research projects. In this way we forefront ethnography as
               a fruitful approach for studying and describing the complexity
               and contingencies of distributed learning in an informed and
               structured way.},

                  groups to find other ways of using the internet
                  ethnographically for television studies. The example of the
                  Antiques Roadshow is used to explore a strategy for
                  ethnographic attention to the diversity of mundane engagements
                  with a particular television text via the internet. The
                  development of this strategy draws on recent thinking on the
                  constitution of ethnographic field sites, focusing on
                  conceptualization of the field as a made object, and
                  development of multi-sited approaches as appropriate forms of
                  engagement with contemporary culture. This strategy also
                  builds on recent debates about the significance of ‘found’
                  digital data for social research. Potential problems with this
                  approach include loss of depth and contextualizing
                  information, and the risk of only focusing on that data which
                  is easily found by dominant search engines. These problems can
                  be offset to some extent by increased focus on reflexivity,
                  and by allowing the field site to spill out beyond the
                  internet as the ethnographer finds it necessary and useful in
                  order to explore particular practices of meaning-making.},

                  way of exploring the detail of the knowledge pro- duction
                  process, some strategic adaptations are prompted by this
                  spatial complexity of e-science. This article describes a
                  study that focused on the biological discipline of sys-
                  tematics, exploring the ways in which use of a variety of
                  information and communica- tion technologies has become a
                  routine part of disciplinary practice. The ethnography
                  combined observation and interviews within systematics
                  institutions with mailing list participation, exploration of
                  web landscapes, and analysis of expectations around infor-
                  mation and communications technologies as portrayed in policy

                  culture. They have been heralded as the new guardians of
                  democracy, a revolutionary form of bottom-up news production
                  and a new way of constructing self and doing community in
                  late-modern times. In this article I highlight the
                  significance of the ‘blogosphere’ as a new addition to the
                  qualitative researcher’s toolkit and some of the practical,
                  theoretical and methodological issues that arise from this.
                  Some of the key ethical issues involved in blog data
                  collection are also considered. The research context is a

                  interest in the development of competence, and, the
                  achievement of professionally purposeful action - as this is
                  done by way of digital technologies - the study exploits the
                  details of a single collaborative design/learning activity
                  among students of architecture. The provided analysis aims at
                  informing the discussion on the role of technically mediated
                  visual reasoning for the emerging professional vision of the
                  to-be architects. By demonstrating the performance of visually
                  complex actions and events - events and actions that could not
                  have occurred outside the particular medium used - the study
                  raises some principled issues. The first issue pertains to the
                  problem of separating the analytical work made by the students
                  from the tools and other resources that enable this work. The
                  second issue concerns how the use of the technology generates
                  new ways of seeing, showing and doing architecture. © The

                  greenhouse effect and global warming reports poor results.
                  Students are claimed to hold misconceptions and na¨ ıve
                  beliefs, and the impact of teaching on their conceptions is
                  also low. In the present na¨ ıve study, these results are
                  called into question, and it is argued that they may to a
                  large extent be seen as artifacts of the research methods
                  deployed, in particular when written questionnaires are
                  used.Whenfollowing students’ projectwork in school over a long
                  period, many of the misunderstandings reported in the
                  literature do not appear. It is argued that the appropriation
                  and use of scientific language when discussing complex
                  socioscientific issues is a gradual process. When observing
                  the language and mediational means students use over time, it
                  is obvious that they are able to identify and use central
                  distinctions in their interactions. They are also able to make
                  productive use of texts and other materials that allow them to
                  successively approximate scientific modes of reasoning. Thus,
                  what students know emerges in communicative practices where
                  they interact with others and with cultural tools in a focused
                  activity. It is argued that students’ knowledge of complex
                  multidisciplinary phenomena of this kind may be particularly
                  ill-suited to conventional questionnaire types of testing.},

                  dynamics of students’ goals and strategies were investigated
                  over 3 years. By examining how these secondary school students
                  (N = 18, from ages 13–15 years) interpret and explain
                  different situations in a new instruc- tional setting, we were

               identity: today's teens seem constantly plugged in to video

               little actual research that investigates the intricate dynamics
               of youth's social and recreational use of digital media. Hanging

               an ambitious three-year ethnographic investigation into how young
               people are living and learning with new media in varied settings
               - at home, in after school programs, and in online spaces. By
               focusing on media practices in the everyday contexts of family
               and peer interaction, the book views the relationship of youth
               and new media not simply in terms of technology trends but

  abstract     = {According to a recent study from the Pew Internet \& American
                  Life project (Lenhardt \& Madden,2005),more than one-half of
                  all teens have created media content,and roughly one- third of
                  teens who use the Internet have shared content they
                  produced.In many cases,these teens are actively involved in
                  what we are calling participatory cultures.A participatory
                  culture is a culture with relatively low barriers to artistic
                  expression and civic engagement,strong support for creating
                  and sharing ones creations,and some type of informal
                  mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is
                  passed along to novices.A participatory culture is also one in
                  which members believe their contributions matter,and feel some
                  degree of social con- nection with one another (at the least
                  they care what other people think about what they have
                  created).Forms of participatory culture include: Affiliations
                  memberships,formal and informal,in online communities centered
                  around various forms of media,such as
                  Friendster,Facebook,message boards, metagaming,game clans,or
                  MySpace). Expressions producing new creative forms,such as
                  digital sampling,skinning and modding,fan videomaking,fan
                  fiction writing,zines,mash-ups). Collaborative Problem-solving
                  working together in teams,formal and informal, to complete
                  tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through
                  Wikipedia,alternative reality gaming,spoiling). Circulations
                  Shaping the flow of media (such as podcasting,blogging). A
                  growing body of scholarship suggests potential benefits of
                  these forms of participatory cul- ture,including opportunities
                  for peer-to-peer learning,a changed attitude toward
                  intellectual property,the diversification of cultural
                  expression,the development of skills valued in the mod- ern
                  workplace,and a more empowered conception of citizenship.
                  Access to this participatory culture functions as a new form
                  of the hidden curriculum,shaping which youth will succeed and
                  which will be left behind as they enter school and the
                  workplace. Some have argued that children and youth acquire
                  these key skills and competencies on their own by interacting
                  with popular culture.Three concerns,however,suggest the need
                  for policy and pedagogical interventions: The Participation
                  Gap the unequal access to the knowledge that will prepare
                  youth for full participation in the world of tomorrow. The
                  Transparency Problem The challenges young people face in

                  traditional forms of professional training and socialization

                  becoming increasingly diverse, extending well beyond the

                  analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related
                  claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of
                  the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second,
                  we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances,
                  conceptualized as interaction between animals and their
                  environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the
                  end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for
                  adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an
                  alternative to Gibson’s ecological psychology. We outline a
                  view of technology affordances as possibilities for human
                  action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational
                  property of a three-way interaction between the person,
                  mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a
                  discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical
                  explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.},

                  methodologies can work in interaction to produce innovative
                  social enquiry. A juxtaposition of two research projects – an
                  ethnography of corridors and a mixed methods study of
                  multimodal authoring and ‘reading’ practices – opened up this
                  encounter. Sensory ethnography within social research methods
                  aims to create empathetic, experiential ways of knowing
                  participants’ and researchers’ worlds. The linguistic field of
                  multimodality offers a rather different framework for research
                  attending to the visual, material and acoustic textures of
                  participants’ interactions. While both these approaches
                  address the multidimensional character of social worlds, the
                  ‘sensory turn’ centres the sensuous, bodied person –
                  participant, researcher and audience/reader – as the ‘place’
                  for intimate, affective forms of knowing. In contrast,
                  multimodal knowledge production is premised on multiple
                  analytic gaps – between modes and media, participants and
                  materials, recording and representation. Eliciting the
                  tensions between sensorial closeness and modal distances
                  offers a new space for reflexive research practice and
                  multiple ways of knowing social worlds.},

                  will affect the progress of CSCL over the next ten years. In
                  particular, we examine the terms technology, affordance, and
                  infrastructure and we propose a relational approach to their
                  use in CSCL. Following a consideration of networks, space, and
                  trust as conditions of productive learning, we propose an
                  indirect approach to design in CSCL. The work supporting this
                  theoretical paper is based on the outcomes of two European
                  research networks: E-QUEL, a network investigating e-quality
                  in e-learning; and Kaleidoscope, a European Union Framework 6
                  Network of Excellence. In arguing for a relational
                  understanding of affordance, infrastructure, and technology we

                  survey showed that LAN gamers were almost exclusively male,
                  with a mean age of 19.5 years. They devoted about 2.6 hours
                  each day to gaming. They were motivated by social contact and
                  a need to know more about games. The competition motive was

                  through which educators meet its challenges more
                  interpretable. Traditionally, cognitive scientists viewed
                  knowledge as a set of propositions comprised of classical
                  concepts, thought as logical inference and language as literal
                  representation of the world. They attributed the same
                  denotative characteristics to cognition as to science text. In
                  contrast, many contemporary cognitive scientists view
                  knowledge as comprised of fuzzy and contextual concepts,
                  thought as perceptually rather than formally grounded, and
                  language as largely metaphorical and narrative. In this view
                  the expressive characteristics of cognitive representations
                  differ from the relatively denotative characteristics of
                  science texts. Science literacy education bridges this
                  difference through practices that help students: build
                  classical concepts on a fuzzy cognitive architecture, achieve
                  formally valid reasoning using perceptually driven operations,
                  and construct written explanations and arguments using
                  speech-like and narrative language.},

                  groupwork in primary school science lessons, aiming in part to
                  see if the IWB is suited to this type of use. Over the course
                  of one school year, twelve primary teachers of Years 4 and 5
                  (8–10 years) took part in a professional development and
                  research programme which involved them in devising a sequence
                  of three science lessons incorporating small-group activity at
                  the IWB. The functionality of the IWB is analysed here as
                  means for supporting the children’s joint communication and
                  thinking, using embedded cues and the availability of certain
                  features in the IWB technology. Our observational analysis of
                  two examples of children’s collaborative activity in different
                  classrooms, together with subsequent group interviews,
                  suggests that the IWB can make some identifiable contributions
                  to children’s productive communication and thinking. However
                  the IWB is not seen to be an entirely distinctive or
                  pedagogically transformative learning resource in the primary
                  classroom. In our developing conceptual framework, the
                  children’s knowledge building is closely related to their
                  active engagement in using IWB affordances and their
                  productive dialogue, essentially supported by the teacher’s
                  scaffolding strategies, the establishment and use of “talk
                  rules” in conversation, and the opportunities and constraints
                  applying in classroom participation structures. These
                  conditions help the children to deal with interconnected
                  social, cognitive, and technical problems arising over time.
                  Certain aspects of this form of computer- supported
                  collaborative learning (CSCL) are discussed. These relate to
                  the integration of the IWB with other classroom learning
                  systems and resources, and to the nature of progression in
                  children’s activity and learning with this new type of highly

                  explore the rich ways in which VMC supports different

               learning as a socially-grounded phenomenon based the writings of
               the Russian philologist, M. M. Bakhtin. Bakhtin's writings on the
               dialogic nature of all texts provide the basis for a new view of
               language, knowledge, and learning. From this perspective,
               learning is seen as the process of multiple voices coming into
               contact, both within and across speaker-produced utterances.
               Examples are provided of two types of studies based on such a
               theory of learning: studies of the appropriation of a social
               language and studies of speech genres. I conclude by recounting
               the potential advantages of adopting dialogicality as a

               paradigm shifts within research on instructional technology (IT).
               Following Kuhn, I will use the term ‘paradigm’ to denote an
               actual scientific achievement. Used in this way, a particular
               experiment or research study must meet two criteria to qualify as
               a paradigm: it must be novel, that is it must be demonstratively
               different from those that came before and it must be sufficiently
               open-ended to provide a basis for further work. In the original
               analysis, I identified four paradigms operating in IT research
               (i.e., CAI, ITS, Logo-as-Latin, CSCL). I re-evaluate the evidence
               for each of these putative paradigms and attempt to sharpen the
               original analysis. In so doing, I focus in particular on the CSCL
               paradigm and assess its status as an emerging paradigm.
               Conducting a Kuhnian analysis of IT research is useful for at
               least two reasons. First, it provides a means of rationalizing
               and lending order to the vast range of activities that fall into
               this broad area of research. Second, such an analysis provides an
               opportunity for reflection—reflection on where the field has been
               and where the field might be going},

                  In particular, we focus on Helen Nissenbaums theory of privacy
                  as contextual integrity and apply it to personal blogs, in
                  general, and the case of the Washingtonienne blogger, in
                  particular. We examine the question of whether personal blogs
                  that are not password protected can be considered normatively
                  private contexts according to Nissenbaums principles of
                  privacy. We argue that they cannot. Using Nissenbaums original
                  model, we conclude that privacy expectations for those who
                  disclose personal information in such blogs are unrealistic.
                  We also suggest that Nissenbaums expanded theory (see
                  Nissenbaum, 2010) can inform the contemporary debate about
                  privacy and blogging in a wide variety of newer technological
                  contexts, in addition to personal blogs, and we encourage
                  researchers to apply Nissenbaums model in those contexts.},

                  design experiments in educational research. We will discuss
                  the implications of a historical and situated interpretation
                  to design experiments, the consequences this has for the
                  analysis of the collected data and empirically based
                  suggestions to improve the designs of the computer-based
                  learning resources. This interpretation differs from that of
                  the majority of other researchers who consider design
                  experiments as fixed interventions. Our interpretation allows
                  for an understanding of students' learning trajectories as
                  part of the school's overall activities, which in turn has
                  implications for suggestions regarding the improvement of
                  computer-based learning resources. We develop argument in
                  three different ways. First, we discuss our interpretation of
                  design experiments and compare it with the dominant debate
                  about design experiments as a methodological approach. Second,
                  we discuss the implications this position has for interaction
                  analysis methods. Finally, we empirically demonstrate this
                  methodological implication by illustrating how vital it might
                  be to consider data collected as part of design experiments as
                  an element of a larger, established institutional setting
                  characterized by inherent socio-cultural features. A
                  conclusion that may be drawn from our situated interpretation
                  of this design experiment is that, to improve students'
                  knowledge constructions, it is not enough - nor is it in
                  principle possible - to perfect the design of the technology.
                  We also need to improve institutional aspects on how schools
                  support students' knowledge constructions when using these
                  technological tools, where the teacher's role in this work is
                  invaluable. A historical and situated interpretation of design
                  experiments provides insight into how these improvements may
                  be made.},

                  article outlines what might be termed a non-representational

                  actor-networks, hybridized practices and networked flows of
                  photographs. The article falls in three parts. It begins with
                  rethinking photography theory. Traditional dualisms between
                  affordance and practice are challenged, and photography is
                  conceptualized as a hybridized, embodied performance. How
                  digital photography changes photography’s traditional
                  affordances is then discussed. The third part discusses
                  various methods to describe how affordances of digital tourist
                  photography are used, twisted and resisted in concrete
                  hybridized practices. I suggest undertaking multi-sided

                  non-representational accounts of mobile practices of

  abstract     = {Students frame activities in school in specific ways which are
                  fundamental for their learning and problem solving. The
                  introduction of digital technology and multimedia applications
                  leads to additional aspects to consider, creating a need for
                  research on interaction and activities in relation to new
                  tools. The aim of this study is to analyze how students frame
                  computer-supported collaborative learning situations. The
                  analytic agenda is based on sociocultural assumptions of
                  learning. Data have been collected through video documentation
                  of secondary school students interactions with educational
                  software in mathematics. The results show that when the
                  students work with task solving in educational software and
                  get stuck, they negotiate how to understand the activity;
                  sometimes they search for the answer in their own actions, and
                  sometimes they consider the answer to be within the
                  technology. Goffmans concept of frameworks can be applied to
                  understand this alternative as a continuous shift between
                  employing social frameworks where the students themselves are
                  playing an active role in the understanding of the task, and
                  employing natural frameworks, where their difficulties are
                  understood to be, in Goffmans words, due to natural
                  determinants, that is, to the design of the technology. The
                  main conclusion is that, in interactional activities using
                  digital technology, there is a possibility that the
                  participants activities are framed in such a way that they do
                  not consider themselves as being accountable for the lack of
                  understanding of the educational content.},

               collaborative learning activities. The evidence shows that under

                  on longer ones constrains likelihood of events on shorter
                  ones. Purely spatial explanations (eg spherical topology for
                  strength of interaction: closer = stronger interaction) don't
                  necessarily work in complex systems. Other dominant
                  topologies: laminar; network. 'Sociotechnical networks' after
                  Latour are v. important for answering q.s on how moments add
                  up to life etc. Many understand these as > 'flat' view,
                  privileging 'moment' and 'event': only local things on human
                  scale exist - all else (eg society, institution)
                  epiphenomenal. But: - events separated in time and space enact
                  same patterns - there are emergent phenomena in *every* level
                  of organization of complex dynamical system, which can't be
                  predicted from analysis of interacting units He argues for
                  dynamical view of complex systems, with fundamental unit of
                  analysis = a process. Participants are defined as they fill
                  roles in that process, rather than in terms of their invariant
                  properties. Every process occurs on a timescale[s]. What's
                  going on, what's participating and how, and how those
                  goings-on interdepend with each other. Properties of substance
                  only have meaning in and through participation in processes.
                  Each scale of organization in ecosocial system integrates
                  faster, local processes into longer-timescale, global
                  processes. Circulation through network of *semiotic artifacts*
                  enables coordination between processes on radically different
                  timescales. 2 key questions: What processes are characteristic
                  of each relevant timescale or organization? How are processes
                  integrated across different timescales? Multiple timescale
                  analysis. Human interactional timescales, eg in classrooms: -
                  immediate: glance / word / sentence - 1 to few seconds 'focal
                  level' - recurrent patterns, exchanges, identifiable cultural
                  patterns / social semiotic formations: eg IRE pattern in
                  classrooms. - recurrent episodes - episodes integrate into
                  lessons - lesson types recur across wide geographical areas,
                  may take days / week to complete - longer timescales:
                  curricula, integrated curricula over years And down from
                  immediate: - phoneme articulation - 1/10 of a second - neuron
                  impulses - few to tens of milliseconds - neuron membrane
                  depolarizations, neurotransmitter flows - millisecond scale At
                  each timescale, characteristic processes and social practices.
                  Processes at next lower timescale make possible repeatable
                  patternings of next longer scale. Higher level process
                  constrains what is likely / appropriate at next scale below.
                  Slow processes function like static backgrounds against faster
                  ones - but they are still processes. Useful to analyse focal
                  level (N) and the one above (N+1) and below (N-1). All new
                  levels of organization emerge as intermediates between
                  pre-existing levels, and change relations among formerly
                  adjacent levels, as well as making possible newer emergent
                  forms. 2 principles governing relationships across scales:
                  ADIABATIC PRINCIPLE adiabatic, meaning 'it doesn't get
                  through'. Energy cannot easily be transferred between a v.
                  fast and a v. slow process. > non-adjacent levels in timescale
                  hierarchy have buffering or filtering effect. Processes that
                  produce change very slowly appear to us to be facts of life.
                  Eg, continents. Very fast processes can't transfer energy to
                  us easily either. SEMIOTICALLY MEDIATED HETEROCHRONY An
                  exception to the adiabatic principle. Heterochrony = long
                  timescale process producing effect in much shorter timescale
                  activity. V. common in human social activity - he believes
                  basis for human social organization across timescales.
                  Longer-term processes and shorter-term events are linked by
                  material object that functions semiotically, as well as
                  materially. Material characteristics of object function as
                  signs for interpreting system belonging to v. different
                  timescale of processes than that of event in which
                  interpreting process taking place. In sociotechnical networks:
                  'boundary objects' (Leigh Star). "Typical in these cases are
                  records ... that are created in many short-term events, but
                  are then collated in some 'center of calcuation' (Latour,
                  1987) to create a summary table or a map (which in turn
                  circulates still further in the network), linking these times,
                  places, and events both as a material object and as a sign or
                  text." p. 281 [Latour 1987 Science in Action]Meaning-inscribed
                  material objects afford heterochrony. Eg, in classrooms,
                  notebooks; textbooks; room architecture; students themselves;
                  ... "Semiotic mediation and heterochrony as the ground of
                  social integration across time and space" p. 282 Another eg:
                  oral tradition of hunter-gatherer societies, cumulative
                  knowledge over timescales and space, mediated by human
                  organisms in ecosocial networks. Identity change - human
                  social development - happens at longer timescale. > How can
                  events on shorter timescales contribute to identity
                  development? Persons make meanings within ecosocial systems.
                  Personal identity is a semiotic articulation. V. complex, not
                  usually explicitly articulated; persistent evaluative stance.
                  We know much more about shorter-term social processes than
                  longer-term or lifespan ones. One person can't get close to
                  doing this. Distributed communities of researchers, working in
                  networks? maybe .... but this changes the nature of social
                  research.},

              UIT-Academic Technology Tufts University 16 Dearborn Road,
              Somerville, MA 02145 Introduction Digital repository technology
              has evolved over the past decades enabling streamlined creation
              and sharing of digital content. Current implementations make it
              feasible to setup repository infrastructures not only for large
              institutions but also for smaller groups and individual users.
              Yet, one of the difficulties in the adoption of the technology
              remains the relative scarcity of powerful tools for publishing
              content to digital repositories. With this in mind, we developed a
              Fedora publishing module allowing instant ingestion of
              VUE-generated content maps in a Fedora repository. We take
              advantage of the relationship facilities within Fedora to build a
              knowledge base of interrelated VUE maps and resources though user
              contributions. Fedora is a flexible repository system with
              powerful digital object model for managing institutional
              repository needs [1]. Fedora has become one of the popular
              repository systems and Tufts University has adopted it as the
              framework for its digital repository [2]. Some of the features,
              which make Fedora appealing to us include versioning, policy
              model, object extensibility, support for rdf, and objects
              relationship management. Often times publishing content into a
              repository involves several stages and complex work flows,
              therefore requiring a lengthy content creation to publishing
              cycle. At Tufts, for instance, publishing content to the Tufts
              Digital library is a multiple-stage process involving coordination
              between many university groups. This process works reasonably well
              for archival content which requires rigorous review, but carries
              too high of an overhead for personal and temporary collections.
              Also, revising and updating the content is time consuming, which
              may lead to out-of-synch objects, which have fallen through the
              cracks. The fedora administrative client, in our opinion, has been
              designed for users with relatively good understanding of Fedora
              and is not appropriate for general content contributors, who don’t
              necessarily possess required technical skills. To simplify the
              workflow of getting objects into repository, applications such as
              Fez [3] and Elated [4] have been developed. Fez is a configurable
              digital repository and workflow management system based on Fedora.
              Elated is a general purpose web-based client for Fedora. While
              these systems are good for authoring smaller collections, they can
              become tedious for creating collections with many objects,
              building relationships, and dynamically updating them. The Visual
              Understanding Environment (VUE) extends the functionality of
              traditional concept mapping applications by allowing users to
              attach content to the nodes or concepts in the concept maps
              [5].Prior to the VUE integration with Fedora, VUE users used to
              create concept maps in isolation, although the content in these
              maps may have been related to that in others’ maps. The value of
              these maps would be much higher if they could be combined with
              maps created by all users in a shared repository. Thus we
              identified the need to integrate VUE with Fedora and enable
              automated publishing of concept maps directly into a Fedora
              repository. Currently, VUE is integrated with many digital
              repository systems including Fedora and allows users to search,
              browse and deposit content back into the digital repository
              systems. In VUE II, the latest version, nodes and links can be
              associated with ontologies, thus making the maps more meaningful
              not just for users but also applications that can understand of
              those ontologies. By taking advantage of these features in VUE, we
              have a developed a system to publish objects from a local VUE
              instance into a Fedora Repository. Objects in a concept map are
              published along with its metadata and relationship information.
              Implementation in VUE A concept map in VUE is considered analogous
              to a network of objects in a repository. Every concept or object
              in VUE can be assigned metadata terms using metadata schemes such
              as Dublin Core or VRA [6]. In addition, users can load additional
              metadata schemes or create their own vocabularies in order to
              assign terms to an object. This metadata is stored along with the
              objects when it is ingested into a repository. Relationships among
              objects are defined by Fedora’s Ontology. When a link of fedora
              ontology type is created it gets deposited in the repository along
              with the object in the RELS-EXT datastream. Thus a rich network of
              objects along with relationships is persisted when the concept map
              is published to the repository. Searching Repository VUE
              implements an Open Knowledge Initiative (OKI) based framework to
              discover objects in digital repositories. Users may perform simple
              or advanced search on a specific repository or a set of
              repositories to retrieve desired content. The results can be
              dragged in to create nodes and build concept maps. The metadata
              associated with the digital objects is also pulled into the map
              and persists with the map. Once these objects are drawn into VUE,
              additional metadata can be associated with the objects. Unique
              Identifiers for Objects A unique identifier (id) is generated for
              every object published to a Fedora repository through VUE. The id
              is 32 bytes long and based on date, time and the physical address
              of the computer. It is of the following format:
              vue:a40711e982405ee401a80747f97a3e30. The chances for collision of
              ids among objects are therefore minimized. Persistence to
              Repository Once users create concept maps they can publish them to
              repository in two modes: Publish Map or Publish All. While Publish
              Map only publishes the map to repository, Publish All mode
              publishes each object in the map, modifies the map to point to the
              object in the repository and then publishes the map to the
              repository. Thus the map with full functionality and all related
              objects exists in the repository and can be shared with other
              users. When the map or a resource in the map is changed and
              re-published the objects in the repository are assigned a new
              version. Metadata Assigning appropriate metadata to objects is an
              essential feature of a system that publishes to repository. VUE
              natively supports adding Dublin Core and VRA metadata to nodes and
              links. Additional metadata schemas can be loaded into VUE by
              changing its configuration file. Alternatively users can create
              custom metadata terms or just tag the objects which get
              transferred to the repository. Ontology for Relationships Every
              object in a concept map when published to Fedora gets relationship
              metadata that connects it to the map it belongs to. VUE also
              supports Fedora relationship ontology terms (RELS-EXT).
              Relationships can be created among objects within a concept map
              and they get persisted in a Fedora Repository thus creating a true
              network of objects connecting an object to all its relatives.
              Implementation/Customization in Fedora Content Models In order to
              accommodate the VUE-generated objects within the Fedora framework,
              we designed three content models – one for VUE maps
              (tufts/vue/map/generic), one for managed objects
              (tufts/vue/other), and one for remote objects (tufts/vue/remote).
              All three models rely on an rdf datastream (RELS-EXT) to define
              their relationships to each other, one payload data stream
              (RESOURCE), and Dublin Core metadata (DC). Each object is assigned
              a unique PID generated in VUE . Security Model The goal of the
              project was to create a Fedora-based collaborative environment
              that would allow the VUE user base to contribute and link to a
              growing content map of resources. It was essential that users be
              allowed to add their relationships to existing objects created by
              other users without having privileges to perform any other
              modification on objects that don’t belong to them. Thus, we
              designed a set of XACML policies that restrict all API-M Fedora
              operations to the owner of the object, while allowing modification
              of the RELS-EXT datastream by all users. We reasoned that a
              Wikipedia-like collaborative model with some restrictions and
              versioning would meet our requirements. It is worth noting that in
              order to allow VUE to create objects using Fedora’s upload
              servlet, we had to allow object creation by all users and also
              provide access to the upload servlet to any user. VUE creates new
              objects in one transaction using FOXML after uploading the managed
              content to Fedora and obtaining the requisite Fedora-assigned URNs
              for the managed datastream. Once the object is ingested, only the
              owner has full control over the object. Collection model We
              represent a VUE map in Fedora as a collection of objects
              corresponding to the resources within the map. Each object
              containing a resource encapsulates relationship metadata
              representing its links to other nodes of the content map. In
              addition, we ingest one object containing the entire map in the
              native VUE format. The map object’s relationship metadata points
              to all the objects representing its nodes. If multiple maps are
              ingested, which share common objects, VUE does not create separate
              resource objects for each content map, but instead reuses the
              already existing resource object within Fedora and adds
              relationship data to it so that it also becomes part of the new
              map. In essence, each content map generated by a VUE user becomes
              a subset within a super-map containing all user-generated map.
              This super-map of resources and relations grows organically
              through each new ingested VUE map, which contains links to
              existing resources. Versioning of objects Fedora provides
              automatic versioning of the objects within the repository. This,
              combined with the policy allowing only modifications to the
              RELS-EXT data stream by non-owners, creates a wiki-like versioned
              collaborative environment which offers the ability to roll back c},

                  I ponder laboriously, shutting off the hot water tap with my
                  left foot. I’m lying in a deep old bathtub full of steaming
                  water, meditating on the niche of communications research that
                  I’m trying to further—mobile appliance user-experience in the
                  context of globalized everyday life. I mentally review my key
                  concepts: “Heidegger . . . Enframing . . . Technology as tool
                  . . . Truth . . . Revealing . . . Poesis . . . Time structures
                  everyday life . . . Poesis creates eruptions of truth.” The
                  faucet painfully leaks out a couple of drops, producing a
                  tight echo in the close confines of the bathroom. “Poetic
                  dwelling is pure being. . . . Pure being in everyday life is
                  possible through poesis. . . . Technology is a tool that
                  enframes. . . . The truth of everyday life constantly erupts,
                  this is poesis.” I take a mental pause, feeling the heat of
                  the water relax my body. “All writing is enframing. . . . Art
                  is an enframing constructed in a way that it works on its own
                  to cause truth to erupt. . . . Artful writing causes truth to
                  erupt. . . . Artful academic writing? Maybe . . .

                  ethnographic methods. . . . Autoethnography . . . ‘Show don’t
                  tell’ . . . That’s artful” I become aware for a moment that
                  I’m staring at the ancient, exposed pipes leading up to the
                  shower head. I notice a spider web growing between the wall
                  and the pipe midway along, as if to intentionally defy the
                  daily morning ritual that washes it away. What a wonderful
                  technology the spider web is. I wonder randomly, “Does the
                  spider have a mythology about the daily
                  destruction/reconstruction of its world? Is it aware that we
                  share a morning ritual? . . . I want to do ethnography of
                  technology. . . Ethnology? No . . . exists already . . . It’s
                  like . . . ‘techno-ethnography’ . . .bah, that sounds like
                  using technology to do ethnography . . . Techno-graphy . . .
                  TECHNOGRAPHY! Yeah, that’s it . . . technography . . .
                  technology in everyday social situations . . . should write it
                  down.” I scramble upright, throw a towel around myself and
                  beat a watery trail across the hardwood floor to the next room
                  in search of a paper and pen. More than three years have
                  passed since that strange man first jumped out of the tub in
                  Urbana, Illinois, and rushed to his desk to write down the
                  word technography. The pool of water on the floor quickly
                  dried, but the tide of ethnographic research in technology has
                  grown steadily and surely since that fateful Google search of
                  the word that evening in 2004. In retrospect, I am only one of
                  many to have “invented” the word. The appropriation of this
                  seemingly long-forgotten anthropological term by industry has
                  been rather complete, having been registered as a trademark by
                  Bernie DeKoven, who claims to have invented it as recently as
                  the 1980s.1 Following DeKoven’s lead, industry uses the word
                  technography to define real-time, multiuser document
                  production. In this scenario, many users network and interface
                  with the technology directly to produce a common text, much
                  like having a group of individuals each equipped with chalk
                  and eraser gathered at a blackboard to produce a text. The
                  virtual space of the interface becomes a tele-magical social
                  arena, where ideas can be bandied about like a ball in a game
                  of soccer. Meanwhile, technology companies interested in
                  intuitive design and culturally specific marketing
                  opportunities have begun hiring ethnographers to work in their
                  research departments, to take up technography more as I have
                  envisioned it. Although qualitative in nature, such research
                  may often be truncated and shaped by the pragmatics of
                  producing “deliverables” within a tight schedule. But
                  corporatization represents only one very thin dimension of the
                  word in contemporary parlance. Academically, the Oxford
                  English Dictionary2 quotes the keyword as far back as 1881,
                  describing technography as the “observing and descriptive
                  stage” of the technological development cycle. However,
                  contemporary interest with recent developments in
                  technological capabilities and potentials have stimulated a
                  fresh anthropological and sociological concern with describing
                  “the arts and crafts of tribes and peoples.”3 Much of this
                  fresh surge in what we might classify as technographic work
                  adopts a Goffmaninformed interactionist approach, referencing
                  classic texts such as The Presentation of Self in Everyday
                  Life (1959), Behavior in Public Places 1102 Qualitative

                  (1971), and Frame Analysis (1974). This grounding has been
                  helpful for numerous academics struggling to make sense of the
                  public–private performative aspects of human “technologically
                  contextualized” behavior that has become particularly visible
                  with the virtualization of experience and congruent
                  mobilization of electronic space (a few examples: Gotved,
                  2006; Humphreys, 2005; Katz \& Sugiyama, 2006; Ling, 2004;
                  Robinson, 2007; Soukup, 2006; Waskul, 2005). Although such
                  work is unquestionably rigorous and often quite academically
                  poignant, Goffman-informed research perpetuates an assumption
                  that the authors in this special issue wish to contend with.
                  That is, it continues to reify technology as a prop or dead
                  “thing” somehow situated outside the arena of social
                  interaction even while it demarcates the boundaries. It is not
                  that we eschew this orientation; there is much we have learned
                  from such work, and will no doubt continue to garner for many
                  years to come. Rather, in the present circumstances of
                  technological evolution, the work in this special issue seeks
                  an approach that enables us to describe what the traditional
                  approach cannot: the intimacy of technology, the relationships
                  and feelings it is bound up in, and the understanding that
                  technology contributes dynamically and dramatically to the
                  performance of everyday life rather than onedimensionally
                  serving as its backdrop and container. Ours is far from the
                  first effort in this direction. Actor–Network Theory (ANT) has
                  held the mantle as a reluctantly pigeonholed “ethnography of
                  technology” for roughly two decades. Technography as we are
                  using the term is not a contender for the title, but rather
                  precedes ANT and might teleologically be considered the genre
                  of inquiry to which ANT belongs (i.e., insofar as we trust the
                  arbitrariness of taxonomies). Although there is much affinity
                  between our motivation and the ANT goal of collapsing
                  modernist inside–outside dualisms, this pushes beyond the
                  traditional ANT approach, which emphasizes attention to the
                  abstract array of forces productive of “things.” It is not so
                  much the array itself that holds our attention here, which
                  suggests maintaining a macro perspective of sorts. Rather, the
                  relationships themselves from an intimately experienced
                  perspective are the concern, one ingredient of what Latour
                  (1986) once referred to as the glue that holds society
                  together.4 The goal here is in essence twofold: to coax
                  socio–techno researchers to embrace the latest advances in
                  qualitative methodologies and push them further, and to
                  encourage qualitative researchers to reconsider traditional
                  assumptions about “dead” space and technology. It is our hope
                  that this vein of research will help us come to terms with
                  some of the social ramifications of exponentially increasing
                  technological changes, which includes everything from robot
                  vacuum cleaners and cars that park themselves, Kien /

                  nature of language. Autopoiesis allows for deeper insights

                  groups in England (1996–2000), along with data from follow-up
                  work involving original and additional participants
                  (2005–ongoing), this paper explores several ethical issues
                  that arose. It traces developing relationships across a
                  13-year period, identifying the problems of attempting to
                  construct a ‘research community’ consisting of individuals
                  with diverse lifestyles, and at times, conflicting agendas. It
                  problematises issues concerning the negotiation and
                  maintenance of access, and considers, also, the prioritisation
                  of certain voices at the expense of others, and the
                  difficulties of ‘openness’ when the researcher is unsure where
                  a project is heading. Rather than engaging with a full
                  literature review of the themes discussed, this paper seeks to
                  highlight the situated negotiation of ethics within a specific
                  research context. The focus is on shifting events in which
                  official codes of practice do not seem to provide an adequate
                  means of navigation. The paper argues that it is not
                  sufficient for the researcher to pay lip service to
                  superficial guidelines, calling, instead, for deeper
                  reflection that might lead to greater honesty with both
                  oneself and the community/communities involved in research. It
                  implies a need to react quickly to events in the field,
                  informing participants about any perceived flaws and
                  ambiguities in the original research design that may have
                  emerged during data collection and led to changes of
                  direction. Finally, it recommends that participants are fully
                  involved in processes, including those that are interpretive,
                  and that they, too, share any benefit of considering the

                  This aim is pursued through the constructivist view of
                  conceptualized learning as building knowledge. It is contended
                  that identities should explicitly be considered as part of
                  this process. Useful approaches to explore the relationship
                  between learning and identity are the Dialogical Self Theory
                  (DST) and the Communities of Learning model (CoL), both of
                  which demonstrate a shared interest in dialogue and
                  constructivism. DST defines the self as being composed of a
                  set of I-positions, which are constantly in dialogue and in
                  movement. The CoL model conceptualizes the classroom as a set
                  of cultural contexts where dialogues permit the analysis of
                  context and also shape it. Empirical examples of how relevant

                  Studying students' learning intentions, rather than certain
                  laptop related activities, we get a deeper understanding of
                  the role the laptop can take during learning activities. Five

                  spaces as sites of mobilization. Looking at linguistic and
                  social aspects, our main questions were: What are the
                  characteristics of the communication in terms of common
                  discursive codes versus fragmentation? In what respects can
                  social order be distinguished, and to what extent are
                  connections between users simply random? Are there any
                  prominent patterns as regards the commitment of participators
                  over time? With the help of tools from semantic, social
                  network and discourse analysis, we were able to show that
                  common codes, networks of connections and mobilization do
                  exist in this context. These patterns can be seen as part of
                  the elaboration of a cognitive praxis'. In order to organize
                  and mobilize, any movement needs to speak a common language,
                  agree on the definition of the situation and formulate a
                  shared vision. Even though it is global and loosely-knit,
                  Twitter discourse is a space where such processes of
                  meaning-production take place.},

                  system, namely ‘WeShare,’ was developed, and conducted with
                  127 junior high school students for performing the given
                  assignment in this study. The participants’ activities of
                  collecting and reviewing relevant information were traced by

                  ‘‘understand.’’ While the range of uses of ‘‘understand’’ is
                  wide, it is interesting to note that there are some clear
                  distributional patterns. An overwhelming majority of the
                  investigated uses concerns the assignment, the purpose of the
                  lab, or the subject matter content. In addition, they are
                  often found in the closing and opening of task-based
                  activities and instructional sequences. One can further note
                  that the investigated uses of ‘‘understand’’ are constrained
                  by different sets of rights and obligations for students and
                  teachers.},

                  can offer to young people as well as fears about the risks it
                  may bring. Informed by research on media literacy, this
                  article examines the role of selected measures of internet
                  literacy in relation to teenagers’ online experiences. Data
                  from a national survey of teenagers in the UK (N = 789) are
                  analyzed to examine: first, the demographic factors that
                  influence skills in using the internet; and, second (the main
                  focus of the study), to ask whether these skills make a
                  difference to online opportunities and online risks.
                  Consistent with research on the digital divide, path analysis
                  showed the direct influence of age and socioeconomic status on
                  young people’s access, the direct influence of age and access
                  on their use of online opportunities, and the direct influence
                  of gender on online risks.The importance of online skills was
                  evident insofar as online access, use and skills were found to
                  mediate relations between demographic variables and young
                  people’s experience of online opportunities and risks.
                  Further, an unexpected positive relationship between online
                  opportunities and risks was found, with implications for
                  policy interventions aimed at reducing the risks of internet

  abstract     = {The notion of a 'community-of-practice' (CmP) has become a
                  highly influential way of conceptualizing how decentralized
                  sub-units or groups within firms or organizations operate.
                  CmPs refer to 'tightly knit' groups that have been practising
                  together long enough to develop into a cohesive community with
                  relationships of mutuality and shared understandings. The CmP
                  notion, however, does not fit squarely with how temporary
                  organizations or project organizations operate. Typically
                  these kinds of groups consist of diversely skilled
                  individuals, most of whom have not met before, who have to
                  solve a problem or carry out a pre-specified task within
                  tightly set limits as to time and costs. As a result they tend
                  to become less well-developed groups, operating on a minimal
                  basis of shared knowledge and understandings. Such a group, I
                  suggest, constitutes a 'collectivity-of-practice' (ClP).
                  Mirroring the above distinctions, two ideal-type notions of
                  epistemology are developed. The one inspired from the CmP
                  literature is discussed in a 'knowledge community'
                  terminology, whereas the one associated with ClPs is conceived
                  of as a 'knowledge collectivity'. Finally, I outline some new
                  options for organizational analysis made possible by
                  recognizing these as two different and complementary notions.

  abstract     = {The idea for this paper came from a debate at the 1998 ISCRAT
                  conference in Denmark on cultural-historical activity theory
                  (CHAT). A leading activist in the movement to bring CHAT into
                  systems design, Bonnie Nardi, asked the question; would design
                  not benefit more from training better ethnographers than from
                  burdening them with such a complex set of theoretical concepts
                  and debates as CHAT? This paper seeks to answer that question
                  on the basis of our experiences applying CHAT concepts in a
                  long-term design ethnography at a UK newspaper. It examines
                  the history of the often controversial triadic relationship
                  between ethnography, theory and systems design and argues that
                  the CHAT framework provided us with the opportunity to move
                  from ethnographic intuition to design insight, and that
                  therefore the answer to Nardi's question is no—simply training
                  good ethnographers is unlikely to be enough for a number of
                  reasons (not least of which is the problem of how
                  inexperienced fieldworkers become design ethnographers). The
                  explicit use of theoretical frameworks, at least those such as
                  CHAT which are particularly suited to design issues,
                  discourages the tendency for ethnographers to see themselves
                  as “proxy users” by encouraging greater reflexivity about the
                  researcher's role in constructing the object of study. At a
                  more pragmatic level, it helps the fieldworker navigate the
                  apparently never-ending mass of “potentially interesting
                  material” any field experience throws up.},

                  management systems can address the complexity of such systems.
                  Three different types of complexity are identified:
                  ontological, societal, and analytical. Significant ideas for
                  “dealing with complexity” are extracted from U.S., Swiss, and
                  U.K. literature on inter- and transdisciplinary research.
                  Based on this, the “boundary work” framework is presented to
                  systematically think through complexity challenges. The
                  framework suggests that inter- and transdisciplinary research
                  on natural research management requires three types of work:
                  (i) the development of suitable boundary concepts that allow
                  thinking of the multidimensionality of NRM issues; (ii) the
                  configuration of adequate boundary objects as devices and
                  methods that allow acting in situations of incomplete
                  knowledge, nonlinearity, and divergent interests; and (iii)
                  the shaping of conducive boundary settings in which these
                  concepts, devices, and methods can be fruitfully developed and
                  effectively put to work. The ideas presented are illustrated
                  with an example of a research program on sustainable land and
                  water management in Uzbekistan. The concluding section
                  highlights three issues important for increasing the

                  struggled to handle contradictory needs of system oriented and
                  user-oriented research. Information retrieval has gradually,
                  starting in the 1960s, moved toward handling the needs of the
                  user. This paper aims to consider the way boundaries toward
                  the user and user-oriented perspectives are drawn,
                  renegotiated and re-drawn. Design/methodology/approach – The
                  central concept of relevance is seen as a boundary concept,
                  complex and flexible, that is continuously redefined in order
                  to manage boundaries. Five influential research papers from
                  the 1960s and early 1970s are analysed in order to understand
                  usage of the concept during a period when psychological and
                  cognitive research tools began to be discussed as a
                  possibility. Findings – Relevance does not only carry an
                  explanatory function, but also serves a purpose relating to
                  the identity of the field. Key contributions on research on
                  relevance seems to, as a by-product, draw a boundary giving
                  legitimacy to certain theoretical resources while demarcating
                  against others. The strategies that are identified in the key
                  texts are intent on finding, representing, justifying and
                  strengthening a boundary that includes and excludes a
                  reasonable amount of complexity associated with the user.
                  Originality/value – The paper explores a central concept
                  within information retrieval and information science in a new
                  way. It also supplies a fresh perspective on the development

                  the ability of children to acquire science concepts and the
                  effect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for
                  a newtool to describe explicit changes in chil-dren's
                  conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972
                  to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have
                  been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and
                  the development of the con-cept mapping tool was an explicit
                  cognitive psychology of learning and an ex-plicit
                  constructivist epistemology. In 1987, collaboration began
                  between Novak and Cañas and others at the Florida Institute
                  for Human and Machine Cogni-tion, then part of the University
                  of West Florida. Extending the use of concept mapping to other
                  applications such as the integration of concept mapping with
                  theWorldWideWeb (WWW) led to the development of software that
                  en-hanced the potential of concept mapping, evolving into the
                  current version of CmapTools nowused worldwide in schools,
                  universities, corporations, and governmental and
                  non-governmental agencies. Differences between concept maps
                  and other knowledge representation tools are described. The
                  integra-tion of concept mapping software programs with the WWW
                  and other new technologies permits a newkind of concept
                  map-centred learning environ-ment wherein learners build their
                  own knowledge models, individually or col-laboratively, and
                  these can serve as a basis for life-long meaningful learning.
                  Combined with other educational practices, use of CmapTools
                  permits a New Model for Education. Preliminary studies are

               structure, through her/his own efforts. The commitment to
               building a powerful knowledge structure must be the learner?s
               commitment. There is less universal recognition that knowledge
               structures are built primarily through meaningful learning, and
               by contrast, rote learning or simply memorizing information
               contributes little to building a person?s knowledge structure.

                  born-digital research environments by discussing the emergence
                  of data mining and the analysis of social media platforms.
                  With the rise of individual online activity in chat rooms,
                  social networking sites and micro-blogging services, new
                  repositories for social science research have become available
                  in large quantities. Given the changes of scale that accompany
                  such research, both in terms of data mining and the
                  communication of results, the authors term this type of
                  research 'massified research'. This article argues that while
                  the private and commercial processing of these new massive
                  data sets is far from unproblematic, the use by academic
                  practitioners poses particular challenges with respect to
                  established ethical protocols. These involve reconfigurations
                  of the external relations between researchers and
                  participants, as well as the internal relations that compose
                  the identities of the participant, the researcher and that of
                  the data. Consequently, massified research and its outputs
                  operate in a grey area of undefined conduct with respect to
                  these concerns. The authors work through the specific case
                  study of using Twitter's public Application Programming
                  Interface for research and visualization. To conclude, this
                  article proposes some potential best practices to extend
                  current procedures and guidelines for such massified research.
                  Most importantly, the authors develop these under the banner
                  of 'agile ethics'. The authors conclude by making the
                  counterintuitive suggestion that researchers make themselves
                  as vulnerable to potential data mining as the subjects who
                  comprise their data sets: a parity of practice. Adapted from

  abstract     = {Participation is a complex process, engaging the whole person,
                  implying cognitive, emotional and relational aspects. In
                  online open and distant learning, group work is a commonly
                  used strategy, given its collaborative nature and
                  constructivist framework (Bates \& Poole, 2003; Garrison \&
                  Anderson, 2003; Jonassen, 2005). In this context,
                  collaborative learning processes are highly dependent on the
                  shared written information and the interactions that are
                  established among the participants. The types of interactions
                  that occur within such groups can influence their knowledge
                  convergence processes, and are often decisive for its success.
                  In this paper we aim to study the different types of
                  collaborative practices in online Courses based on the
                  analysis of the online interactions on the discussion forums,
                  the works produced by the students (both individually and in
                  small groups), and answers to questionnaires applied in the
                  different stages of the investigation. In this particular case
                  we are interested in exploring questions related to the
                  process of knowledge convergence during online group work in
                  Open and Distance Learning. Data analysis involved iterative
                  analysis and revision of the coding scheme. Two of the
                  researchers derived the initial coding key from the online
                  discussion forums used during the group project phase of the
                  Curricular Unit. Some of the codes were quantified in order to
                  foster a more meaningful comparison of the data by allowing
                  patterns to be identified and further explored (McConnell,
                  2006). In this study, it became clear that the more and less
                  successful groups, in terms of their outcome or product,
                  clearly revealed distinctive patterns of work, characterized
                  by negotiation, research, conception and production. Moreover,
                  particular patterns of work make decisive contributions for
                  the participants' shared knowledge and knowledge convergence.

                  agencies alike are looking to social network analysis (SNA)
                  tools for insight into trends, connections, and fluctuations
                  in social media. Microsoft's NodeXL is a free, open-source SNA
                  plug-in for use with Excel. It provides instant graphical
                  representation of relationships of complex networked data. But
                  it goes further than other SNA tools - NodeXL was developed by
                  a multidisciplinary team of experts that bring together
                  information studies, computer science, sociology,
                  human-computer interaction, and over 20 years of visual
                  analytic theory and information visualization into a simple
                  tool anyone can use. This makes NodeXL of interest not only to
                  end-users but also to researchers and students studying visual
                  and network analytics and their application in the real world.
                  In Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL, members of the
                  NodeXL development team up provide readers with a thorough and
                  practical guide for using the tool while also explaining the
                  development behind each feature. Blending the theoretical with
                  the practical, this book applies specific SNA instructions
                  directly to NodeXL, but the theory behind the implementation
                  can be applied to any SNA. Walks readers through using NodeXL
                  while explaining the theory and development behind each step,
                  providing takeaways that can apply any SNA Demonstrates how
                  visual analytics research can be applied to SNA tools for the
                  mass market Presents readers with case studies using NodeXL on
                  popular networks like email, Facebook, Twitter, and wikis.},

                  subjects performed a collaborative task remotely and
                  communicated either via video and audio links or audio links
                  only. Using the same task (the 'map task'), Boyle et al.
                  (1994) found clear benefits of seeing the face compared with
                  audio-only co-present interaction. Pairs who could see each
                  other needed to say less to achieve the same level of
                  performance as pairs who could only hear each other. In
                  contrast to these findings, in all three experiments reported
                  here, users of video links produced longer and more
                  interrupted dialogues than those who had audio links only,
                  although there were no differences in performance. Performance
                  was affected when the video links were of low bandwidth,
                  resulting in transmission delays. The drop in accuracy was
                  correlated with a significant increase in levels of
                  interrupted speech. We also compared the structure of
                  dialogues and the use of gaze in high-quality video-mediated
                  communication with those produced in face-to-face co-present
                  interactions. Results show that both face-to-face and
                  video-mediated speakers use visual cues to check for mutual
                  understanding. When they cannot see each other such checks
                  need to be conducted verbally, accounting for the length
                  effect in dialogues. However, despite using visual cues in the
                  same way as face-to-face speakers, video does not provide the
                  same advantage of shorter and less interrupted dialogues. In
                  addition, users of video gaze far more overall than
                  face-to-face speakers. We suggest that when speakers are not
                  physically co-present they are less confident in general that
                  they have mutual understanding, even though they can see their
                  interlocutors, and therefore over-compensate by increasing the
                  level of both verbal and nonverbal information.},

               to collaborate on short-term objectives. Such collaborations may
               reflect coming changes in globalized work in which we
               increasingly work with remote others we know little about. In
               game play, the glue that keeps groups together is the shared
               objective of completing a "quest" or mission, as well as the
               shared culture of the game. The game is rich in meaning with a
               strong narrative, a material culture of weapons, armor, potions,
               recipes, jewelry, and many other goods, as well as a vibrant
               economy. Players' backgrounds are diverse but discourse
               emphasizes understandings about the game rather than players'
               personal lives. Players learn to be at ease with strangers, to
               get things done with others they don't know and may never
               interact with again. The game diminishes some of the impact of

                  focuses on a key paper where Engestrom defines the nature and
                  present state of activity theory. Beginning with a brief
                  account of the relations between activity theory and ontology,
                  the paper asserts that Engestrom's take on Vygotsky is
                  restricted by a commitment to a progressive, apolitical
                  ideology of improvement. The paper goes on to consider
                  Vygotsky's metaphysics in relation to Heidegger's elaboration
                  of ontology, and Engestrom's elaboration of what activity
                  theory is and of its global mission. Engestrom's activity
                  theory is defined in terms of its expression of a
                  will-to-power and is questioned in terms of its lack of

               and implement advanced socio-cognitive processes for knowledge
               sharing and knowledge building. But do we really understand these
               processes that are supposed to be implemented? This paper will
               focus on the "epistemological infrastructure" of CSCL. We will
               analyze three models of innovative knowledge communities in order
               to better understand basic epistemological processes of knowledge
               advancement: i.e., Nonaka and Takeuchi's model of
               knowledge-creating organization, Yrjö Engeström's expansive
               learning model, and Carl Bereiter's theory of knowledge building.
               It is argued that these models provide a way of overcoming the
               dichotomy of the acquisition and participation metaphors of
               learning by providing a third metaphor of learning as a process
               of knowledge creation. In order to facilitate educational change
               through CSCL also certain kind of larger social infrastructure is
               needed that supports these epistemological processes.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores how wikis may be used to support primary
                  education students’ collaborative interaction and how such an
                  interaction process can be charac- terised. The overall aim of
                  this study is to analyse the collaborative processes of
                  students working together in a wiki environment, in order to
                  see how primary students can actively create a shared context
                  for learning in the wiki. Educational literature has already
                  reported that wikis may support collaborative
                  knowledge-construction processes, but in our study we claim
                  that a dialogic perspective is needed to accomplish this.
                  Students must develop an intersubjective orientation towards
                  each others’ perspectives, to co-construct knowledge about a
                  topic. For this purpose, our project utilised a ‘Thinking
                  Together’ approach to help students develop an intersubjective
                  orientation towards one another and to support the creation of
                  a ‘dialogic space’ to co-construct new understanding in a wiki
                  science project. The students’ asynchronous interaction
                  process in a primary classroom—which led to the creation of a
                  science text in the wiki—was analysed and characterised, using
                  a dialogic approach to the study of CSCL practices. Our
                  results illustrate how the Thinking Together approach became
                  embedded within the wiki environment and in the students’
                  collaborative processes. We argue that a dialogic approach for
                  examining interaction can be used to help design more
                  effective pedagogic approaches related to the use of wikis in
                  education and to equip learners with the competences they need
                  to participate in the global knowledge-construction era.},

                  ongoing ethnographic study of mathematics teacher education at
                  a Swedish University. Using Bernsteins' language of
                  description of the pedagogic device the article describes how
                  the aims of teacher education to re-contextualise mathematical
                  education towards greater student subject knowledge is
                  thwarted by a strongly classified and framed practice that
                  obstructs student teachers from developing a vertical
                  knowledge structure in mathematics due to performative
                  priorities. The mathematical knowledge to which students are
                  subjected takes more the form of a horizontal discourse and
                  this is problematic for their knowledge development. A
                  horizontal discourse reduces student access to important forms
                  of knowledge by which they can challenge tradition and
                  consciously change their practice. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and

                  However, when used within professional development activity,
                  it is fraught with issues associated with teacher confidence
                  and skill in reflective action. Coupled with anxiety generally
                  associated with technological competency and understanding the
                  nature of blogging, constructive reflection is difficult for
                  teachers. This paper focuses on the reflective quality of
                  teachers’ blogs. It describes teachers’ perceptions and
                  engagement in reflective activity as part of an ICT
                  professional development program. Reflective entries are drawn
                  from a series of blogs that are analysed qualitatively using
                  Hatton’s and Smith’s (1995) three levels of
                  reflection-on-action. The findings suggest that each level of
                  reflective action plays a different role in enabling teachers
                  to transform their ICT pedagogical beliefs and practices. Each
                  role is defined and illustrated suggesting the value of such

                  to understand the construction of meaning during collaborative
                  concept mapping. The focus of this report is the teacher who
                  engages students through the emerging concept maps in
                  reflections about their knowledge of scientific concepts and
                  how they are integrated in a larger framework. It is based on
                  data collected over a two-year span with about 150 students in
                  ten sections of junior and senior physics. The data include
                  video-taped concept-mapping sessions, concept maps produced
                  during these sessions and those produced individually at home,
                  reflective essays by the students, and the teacher's
                  reflective notes. Based on the data sources, three major
                  dimensions were constructed. First, concept maps served as
                  conscription devices which enlisted the participation of
                  students and their teacher who constructed and used them for a
                  variety of purposes. Second, the teacher engaged students in
                  reflections about their knowledge through the conscription
                  device and in his role as a coach-facilitator-guide. Third, in
                  this role, the teacher conducted dynamic assessments of
                  student understanding which were then used to intervene to
                  help students construct meaning of scientific concepts
                  compatible with scientific knowledge. This process of
                  evaluation and intervention by the teacher was conceptualized
                  as coach-facilitator-guide in the metaphor of the reflective
                  practitioner. We conclude that, in our construction,
                  collaborative concept mapping becomes a context which can
                  assist teachers in changing their referents of action from
                  objectivist to constructivist metaphors of teaching.},

  abstract     = {Research on learning science in informal settings and the
                  formal (sometimes experimental) study of learning in
                  classrooms or psychological laboratories tend to be separate
                  domains, even drawing on different theories and methods. These
                  differences make it difﬁcult to compare knowing and learning
                  observed in one paradigm/context with those observed in the
                  other. Even more interestingly, the scientists studying
                  science learning rarely consider their own learning in
                  relation to the phenomena they study. A dialectical, reﬂexive
                  approach to learning, however, would theorize the movement of
                  an educational science (its learning and development) as a
                  special and general case—subject matter and method—of the
                  phenomenon of learning (in/of) science. In the dialectical
                  approach to the study of science learning, therefore, subject
                  matter, method, and theory fall together. This allows for a
                  perspective in which not only disparate ﬁelds of study—school
                  science learning and learning in everyday life—are integrated
                  but also where the progress in the science of science learning
                  coincides with its topic. Following the articulation of a
                  contradictory situation on comparing learning in different
                  settings, I describe the dialectical approach. As a way of
                  providing a concrete example, I then trace the historical
                  movement of my own research group as it simultaneously and
                  alternately studied science learning in formal and informal
                  settings. I conclude by recommending cultural-historical,
                  dialectical approaches to learning and interaction analysis as
                  a context for fruitful interdisciplinary research on science
                  learning within and across different settings.},

                  that, contrary to the intentions to renew and revitalise
                  education, ICT in use seemed to operate as a relay in the
                  reproduction of traditional ways of teaching and learning.
                  However, the investigation is not one of the failures of
                  education to make use of ICT but one that tries to distance
                  itself from the traditional enthusiastic rhetoric, with the
                  ambition to contribute to a more realistic discussion.
                  Bernstein’s concept of pedagogical discourse has been used.

                  on the authors’ experiences in research involving medical
                  consultations. Previous observational studies in this ﬁeld
                  have used either direct observation or analogue videotapes.
                  Traditionally, analysis is then done on transcriptions of the
                  tapes, using conversation analysis or other techniques. These
                  techniques were formed and created using largely analogue
                  audiotapes. We will demonstrate how digital video increases
                  the richness of data, such that conversation analysis becomes
                  interaction analysis. Additionally, we argue that digital
                  video changes the relationship between reader, researcher and
                  data. A consideration of these changes is important to framing
                  a comprehensive methodological approach to using digital video
                  observation. Digital video needs to be considered in terms of
                  what it offers in and of itself, rather than relating it to
                  other techniques.},

                  positive and negative aspects in comparison to traditional
                  classification. The authors biased support of traditional
                  classification and the Aristotelian tradition is evident in
                  the tone and style of writing. During class discussion, Dr.
                  Jacob repeatedly emphasizes that classification and
                  categorization are not the same thing and Peterson
                  fundamentally confuses the arguments by using them
                  interchangeably. Folksonomy is defined by the author as a
                  collaborative categorization or annotation process and, from a
                  related reading, Gruber (2007) emphasizes that folksonomy is
                  not a taxonomy or even a collaborative categorization; thus
                  folksonomy advocates appear to make no attempt at
                  classification or taxonomy. In this light, the basic premise
                  of the article is questionable in its attempt to argue that
                  folksonomy is not a suitable classification scheme. The author

  abstract     = {Abstract In this paper, we take up and advance the project of
                  rethinking “scientific literacy” by Eisenhart, Finkel, and
                  Marion (American Educational Research Journal, 1996, 33,
                  261–295). As part of a project of rethinking science
                  education, we advance three propositions. First, because
                  society is built on division of labor, not everybody needs to
                  know the same basic sets of concepts; it is more important to
                  allow the emergence of scientific literacy as a collective
                  property. Second, scientific knowledge ought not to be
                  privileged in democratic collective decision making but ought
                  to be one of many resources. Third, rethinking science
                  education as and for participation in community life sets up
                  the potential for lifelong participation in and learning of
                  science‐related issues. To show the viability of these
                  propositions, we provide a case study based on a 3‐year,
                  multisite ethnographic research project as part of which we
                  investigated science in the community. Framing our work in
                  terms of activity theory, we provide descriptions of science
                  in a local middle school, where students learn science while
                  participating in a community effort to contribute to the
                  knowledge base about a local creek. The children's activities
                  are continuous with those of adults concerned about
                  environmental health. In this way, rather than preparing for
                  life after school, science education allows students to
                  participate in legitimate ways in community life and therefore
                  provides a starting point for uninterrupted lifelong learning
                  across the presently existing boundary separating formal
                  schooling from everyday life outside schools. © 2004 Wiley

                  interaction (a ‘‘dialogical’’ approach), one should
                  distinguish a ‘‘trialogical’’ approach, i.e., learning as a

                  processes where common objects of activity are developed

                  important in a knowledge society. We review three approaches

  abstract     = {Computers are classically viewed as amplifiers of cognition.
                  An alternative conceptualization is offered of computer as
                  reorganizer of mental functioning. Software analyses
                  illuminate the advantages of the latter approach for new
                  visions of the potential cognitive benefits of computers. A
                  new result emerges: Because the cognitive technologies we
                  invent serve as instruments of cultural redefinition (shaping
                  who we are by changing, not just amplifying, what we do),
                  defining educational values becomes a foreground issue. The
                  demands of an information society make an explicit e~phasis on
                  general cognitive skills a priority. The urgency of updating
                  education's goals and methods recommends an activist research
                  paradigm: to simultaneously create and study changes in
                  processes and outcomes of human learning with new cognitive

                participation behavior in the largest question-answering online
                community in South Korea, Naver Knowledge–iN. We collected and
                analyzed over 2.6 million question/answer pairs from ﬁfteen
                categories between 2002 and 2007, and have interviewed twenty
                six users to gain insights into their motivations, roles, usage
                and expertise. We ﬁnd altruism, learning, and competency are
                frequent motivations for top answerers to participate, but that
                participation is often highly intermittent. Using a simple
                measure of user performance, we ﬁnd that higher levels of
                participation correlate with better performance. We also observe
                that users are motivated in part through a point system to build
                a comprehensive knowledge database. These and other insights

                  people articulate their information needs and provide
                  information to others differently in online sites of various
                  types, more specifically, blogs and internet discussion
                  forums. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on
                  the analysis of ten blogs and 40 threads of Suomi24, a Finnish
                  internet discussion forum. The blogs and discussion threads
                  focus on the same topic, that is, coping with depression. For
                  the study, 1,044 blog postings, 1,727 bloggers' and blog
                  readers' comments and 1,236 messages written by the discussion
                  forum participants were analyzed by means of descriptive
                  statistics and qualitative content analysis. Findings - The
                  bloggers, blog readers and discussion group participants
                  mainly articulated needs related to getting an opinion or
                  evaluation of an issue, while needs for factual information
                  and procedural information about possible ways of action were
                  presented less frequently. Information provision drew strongly
                  on the use of personal knowledge. There were no remarkable
                  differences between the types of online sites with regard to
                  the articulation of information needs and using sources for
                  providing information to others. Research
                  limitations/implications - The findings are based on the
                  analysis of a limited number of Finnish blogs and discussion
                  threads in the field of coping with depression. Thus, the
                  findings cannot be generalized to all online forums of these
                  kinds. Practical implications - Blogs and internet discussion
                  forums provide useful sites to pose questions for online
                  contributors and to get opinions as well as factual
                  information about the ways to cope with depression.
                  Originality/value - The study is unique in that it compares
                  information needs and information provision in online sites of
                  various types.},

                  important to engage in explicit discussions of how learning is

                  that construe human mental activities and resources in terms
                  of physical objects. This is evident, for instance, in modern
                  cognitive science where computer metaphors (information
                  processing and information storage) have been foundational for
                  the discipline. However, this tendency to reify human
                  activities can be found in many other traditions, and it goes
                  back to ancient Greek thinking. It is argued that the
                  consequences of this tradition of reification are significant
                  for the human sciences. One important element of these types
                  of metaphors is that they describe people and their capacities

                  Peter Tittenberger and I have had the opportunity to explore
                  the role of technology in transforming learning. From
                  conversations during these engagements, a set of concerns has
                  emerged: 1. Educators express interest in improving their
                  teaching and learning practices, particularly emphasizing the
                  need to improve engagement of learners (online or in-class).
                  2. While concerned about improving teaching and learning,
                  educators generally resist: a. Advanced pedagogical
                  discussions that are not readily transferable to the online or
                  face-to-face classroom b. Technology-heavy hype and
                  suggestions that the social element of learning can somehow be
                  replaced.},

  abstract     = {Recognition in education is the acknowledgment of learning
                  achievements. Accreditation is certification of such
                  recognition by an institution, an organization, a government,
                  a community, etc. There are a number of assessment methods by
                  which learning can be evaluated (exam, practicum, etc.) for
                  the purpose of recognition and accreditation, and there are a
                  number of different purposes for the accreditation itself
                  (i.e., job, social recognition, membership in a group, etc).
                  As our world moves from an industrial to a knowledge society,
                  new skills are needed. Social web technologies offer
                  opportunities for learning, which build these skills and allow
                  new ways to assess them. This paper makes the case for a
                  peer-based method of assessment and recognition as a feasible
                  option for accreditation purposes. The peer-based method would
                  leverage online communities and tools, for example digital
                  portfolios, digital trails, and aggregations of individual
                  opinions and ratings into a reliable assessment of quality.
                  Recognition by peers can have a similar function as formal
                  accreditation, and pathways to turn peer recognition into
                  formal credits are outlined. The authors conclude by
                  presenting an open education assessment and accreditation
                  scenario, which draws upon the attributes of open source
                  software communities: trust, relevance, scalability, and
                  transparency.},

                  on perceived ease of use and usefulness. Although studies have
                  shown social interactions are important to teachers, no study
                  has analyzed the mediating influence of social presence and
                  sociability within e-learning professional development.
                  Therefore, the original TAM was expanded to encompass user
                  perceptions of social presence and sociability. Structural
                  equation modeling was used to measure the mediating affects on
                  their intention to continue using e-learning for their
                  professional development. The results indicate that the
                  expanded hypothesized model was a good predictor of
                  continuance intention. Perceived ease of use, perceived
                  usefulness and social presence were found to be significant
                  determinants of teachers’ intent to continue using e-learning
                  to meet their future professional development needs. The
                  results have implications for educational leaders, designers

                  professional development and embed e-learning conditions that

                  geographic distances and time within library and information
                  science (LIS). Design/methodology/approach - A total of four
                  studies were conducted focusing on: the design of a virtual
                  research environment (VRE) to facilitate the sharing of data
                  collection instruments among students, researchers and
                  professionals; new ways professionals and researchers can
                  collaborate; collaborative decision making in the context of
                  purchasing a library management system; and collaboration
                  among LIS professionals. Findings - Early results show that
                  VREs within LIS can build on previous VRE research which
                  focused on other domains. However, there are several unique
                  characteristics of LIS that place requirements on VREs and
                  which are not yet implemented within VREs and that offer
                  unique opportunities for VREs to enhance LIS research,
                  education and practice. Originality/value - This paper reports
                  on ongoing research and preliminary findings of unique studies
                  investigating how VREs could enhance LIS research and
                  professional practice, and how LIS research and practice can
                  inspire the next generation of VREs.},

               dimensional starting point for conceptualizing and studying a
               specific variant of CSCL. These four contributions to CSCL are
               inter-related. The notion of collaborative knowledge building
               defines a useful paradigm for conceptualizing learning as social
               practice. The social interactions and knowledge management
               activities in which shared knowledge is constructed can be
               analyzed as the result of interweaving group and personal
               conversational perspectives. In general, collaborative
               interaction is mediated by artifacts: sometimes only by
               transitory artifacts like spoken words or gestures, but
               increasingly by physical or digital artifacts and media.
               Empirical studies of collaborative knowledge building employing
               micro-ethnographic analysis of speech, gesture, artifacts and
               media can make the details of these collaboration interactions
               visible, highlighting the interplay of perspectives and artifacts
               in the trans-personal construction of knowledge. A theoretical
               framework incorporating models of knowledge building,
               perspectives and artifacts – and grounded in empirical analysis
               of collaborative interaction – can guide the design of
               computer-based artifacts and media as support for collaborative
               learning with appropriate, elaborated and unified

               branch of the learning sciences concerned with studying how
               people can learn together with the help of computers. As we will
               see in this essay, such a simple statement conceals considerable
               complexity. The interplay of learning with technology turns out
               to be quite intricate. The inclusion of collaboration, computer
               mediation and distance education has problematized the very
               notion of learning and called into question prevailing
               assumptions about how to study it. Like many active fields of
               scientific research, CSCL has a complex relationship to
               established disciplines, evolves in ways that are hard to
               pinpoint and includes important contributions that seem
               incompatible. The field of CSCL has a long history of controversy
               about its theory, methods and definition. Furthermore, it is
               important to view CSCL as a vision of what may be possible with
               computers and of what kinds of research should be conducted,
               rather than as an established body of broadly accepted laboratory
               and classroom practices. We will start from some popular
               understandings of the issues of CSCL and gradually reveal its
               more complex nature. We will review CSCL’s historical development

                  infrastructure with some of the tools and perspectives of
                  ethnography. Infrastructure is both relational and
                  ecological—it means different things to different groups and
                  it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built
                  environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently
                  mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as
                  plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the
                  difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up
                  from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large
                  quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs,
                  and how to understand the interplay of online and offline
                  behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting
                  these challenges include studying the design of
                  infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure
                  as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in

                  characterizing how people as learners are constituted in and
                  between settings. Focusing on the concept of self represents
                  an attempt to address what becomes of the person in
                  sociocultural and dialogical theorizing. Through a discussion
                  of central concepts in dialogical theory, we outline three
                  analytical resources to examine and identify cultural
                  constructions of learning selves. The first is narratives, the
                  second categories, and the last inscriptions. By working
                  through an episode of interaction, where a teacher and his
                  students discuss and negotiate the use of a particular
                  learning resource in school, we demonstrate how the analytical
                  resources enable us to study the process through which
                  particular versions of learning selves are put together and
                  contrasted. Finally, we discuss the implications for

                  arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between illstructured
                  and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the
                  concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive
                  flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this

                  play was a complex process of appropriation and resistance,

                  occurred through recursive cycles of failure and revising
                  strategies, which led to frustration, engagement and learning.
                  Students developed familiarity with game concepts and deeper

                  activity theory and ethnomethodology in the place of artifacts
                  in everyday working practice. I review briefly some basic

                  studies of artifacts-in-use. I then offer a preliminary
                  account of computer-aided and paper-based design work in civil
                  engineering, informed by both perspectives. My account
                  emphasizes the multiplicity of media and associated objects

  abstract     = {Abstract The relationship between interaction and learning is
                  a central concern of the learning sciences, and analysis of
                  interaction has emerged as a major theme within the current
                  literature on computer-supported collaborative learning. The
                  nature of technology-mediated interaction poses analytic
                  challenges. Interaction may be distributed across actors,
                  space, and time, and vary from synchronous, quasi-synchronous,
                  and asynchronous, even within one data set. Often multiple
                  media are involved and the data comes in a variety of formats.
                  As a consequence, there are multiple analytic artifacts to
                  inspect and the interaction may not be apparent upon
                  inspection, being distributed across these artifacts. To
                  address these problems as they were encountered in several
                  studies in our own laboratory, we developed a framework for
                  conceptualizing and representing distributed interaction. The
                  framework assumes an analytic concern with uncovering or
                  characterizing the organization of interaction in sequential
                  records of events. The framework includes a media independent
                  characterization of the most fundamental unit of interaction,
                  which we call uptake. Uptake is present when a participant
                  takes aspects of prior events as having relevance for ongoing
                  activity. Uptake can be refined into interactional
                  relationships of argumentation, information sharing,
                  transactivity, and so forth for specific analytic objectives.
                  Faced with the myriad of ways in which uptake can manifest in
                  practice, we represent data using graphs of relationships
                  between events that capture the potential ways in which one
                  act can be contingent upon another. These contingency graphs
                  serve as abstract transcripts that document in one
                  representation interaction that is distributed across multiple
                  media. This paper summarizes the requirements that motivate
                  the framework, and discusses the theoretical foundations on
                  which it is based. It then presents the framework and its
                  application in detail, with examples from our work to
                  illustrate how we have used it to support both ideographic and
                  nomothetic research, using qualitative and quantitative
                  methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of the
                  frameworks potential role in supporting dialogue between
                  various analytic concerns and methods represented in CSCL.},

                  Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) appears healthy, while
                  encompassing a diversity of topics of study, methodologies,
                  and representatives of various research communities. It is an
                  appropriate time to ask: what central questions can integrate
                  our work into a coherent field? This paper proposes the study
                  of technology affordances for intersubjective meaning-making
                  as an integrating research agenda for CSCL. A brief survey of
                  epistemologies of collaborative learning and forms of computer
                  support for that learning characterize the field to be
                  integrated and motivate the proposal. A hybrid of
                  experimental, descriptive and design methodologies is proposed
                  in support of this agenda. A working definition of
                  intersubjective meaning-making as joint composition of
                  interpretations of a dynamically evolving context is provided,
                  and used to propose a framework around which dialogue between
                  analytic approaches can take place. 1},

                  insufficiently addressed by prior research and practice is
                  that almost all of the significant problems of to- morrow will
                  be systemic problems, which cannot be addressed by any one

                  workers to work in teams, commu- nities, and organizations
                  that encompass multiple ways of knowing and collaborating. A
                  second basic challenge is that learning can no longer be
                  dichotomized into a place and time to acquire knowledge
                  (school) and a place and time to apply knowledge (the

               "tool," but as part of our social and psychological lives; she
               looks beyond how we use computer games and spreadsheets to
               explore how the computer affects our awareness of ourselves, of
               one another, and of our relationship with the world.
               "Technology," she writes, "catalyzes changes not only in what we
               do but in how we think." First published in 1984, The Second Self
               is still essential reading as a primer in the psychology of
               computation. This twentieth anniversary edition allows us to
               reconsider two decades of computer culture–to (re)experience what
               was and is most novel in our new media culture and to view our
               own contemporary relationship with technology with fresh eyes.
               Turkle frames this classic work with a new introduction, a new
               epilogue, and extensive notes added to the original text.Turkle
               talks to children, college students, engineers, AI scientists,
               hackers, and personal computer owners–people confronting machines
               that seem to think and at the same time suggest a new way for us
               to think–about human thought, emotion, memory, and understanding.
               Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on
               the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of
               the self and part of the external world. Their special place
               betwixt and between traditional categories is part of what makes
               them compelling and evocative. (In the introduction to this
               edition, Turkle quotes a PDA user as saying, "When my Palm
               crashed, it was like a death. I thought I had lost my mind.") Why
               we think of the workings of a machine in psychological terms–how
               this happens, and what it means for all of us–is the ever more
               timely subject of The Second Self.}

                  continuing importance of bodily technique and skill in
                  fieldwork from a mobilities perspective. It develops an
                  approach to technology and technique from Marcel Mauss to
                  consider the relationship between ethnography as a
                  technological enterprise and as a set of bodily skills.
                  Evidence is presented on technology as 'gear' amongst
                  hill-walkers in north east Scotland, many of whom adhere to a
                  'low-tech' aesthetic. Drawing inspiration from them, the
                  suggestion is made that ethnographers should be cautious of
                  adopting 'high-tech' tools for their research. Examples of GPS
                  (Global Positioning System) use amongst the hill-walkers and
                  in cases from the literature illustrate these themes. Finally,
                  the article argues that making the techniques of ethnographic
                  research more broadly known might have the advantage of making
                  the results more useable and accessible.},

                  researchers, this article is an examination of contemporary
                  challenges posed when dealing with the ethical principle of
                  anonymity in qualitative research, specifically at the point
                  of dissemination. Drawing on their respective doctoral
                  experience and literature exploring the difficulties that can
                  arise from the application of anonymity with regard to
                  historical and geographical contexts, the authors question the
                  applicability of the principle of anonymity alongside
                  pressures to disseminate widely. In so doing, the article
                  considers anonymity in relation to the following:
                  demonstrating value for money to funders; being accountable to
                  stakeholders; involvement in knowledge transfer; and the
                  demands of putting as much information ‘out there’ as
                  possible, particularly on the internet. In light of these
                  pressures, the article suggests that the standard of anonymity

                  traditional form of ethnography. It recognises that all
                  traditions change, but puts forward a view that, for an
                  activity or product to be regarded as ethnographic, there is a
                  need for some recognisable continuity with what has been
                  regarded as ethnography in the last century. This article thus
                  presents a defence of rigour and systematic research within
                  ethnography. It is not a response to the other papers within
                  this special issue, but it does put forward a case for a
                  particular form of ethnographic research and representation
                  that follows rigorous research methods and presents the
                  findings of that research in a systematic and clear way. The
                  first section of the article discusses the nature of
                  ethnography that I wish to promote. The second provides a
                  critique of some specific cases where the authors wish to
                  apply the term ethnography, focussing on autoethnography and
                  performance ethnography. The conclusion suggests ways in which
                  these newer forms of qualitative inquiry might be made more
                  rigorous and thus warrant the name ethnography as it has been

               published in recent years on medical law. However it is
               increasingly apparent that a focus on individual medical
               treatments as an approach to the determination of health is
               inappropriate,and that health is determined as much by health
               policies as by medicine. The introduction of the dialogue of
               human rights into domestic law, along with recognition of the
               global nature of threats to health from disease, the environment
               and development, necessitate a broader approach to health law
               commentary. This book addresses the legal framework and
               regulation of the public dimension of health. The constraints on
               formulation of health policies and the legal infrastructure of
               health regulation at national, European and international level
               are examined. Particular health concerns are then considered in
               the context of law. This book provides an essential text for any
               health law or public health programme, and will be useful to
               commentators with research interests in any area of health.},

  abstract  = {This title reflects the crawling scepticism of learning
               scientists with the respect to the hype of MOOCs. Beyond
               individuals, the learning science community is not much engaged.
               As MOOCs stand today, the activities proposed to student remain
               quite rudimentary compared to those developed in learning
               science. Let's consider the two mammals of learning sciences,
               socio-cultural theories and constructivism. The first one
               encounters some kind of renaissance through the so-called cMOOCs,
               for 'connectivist' MOOCs, but this renaissance occurs in the
               shadow of xMOOCs. At a first glance xMOOCs are in contradiction
               with constructivism. Their most salient part, video lectures,
               simply perpetuate a pedagogical practice, lecture, that remains
               ubiquitous in higher education despite empirical evidence of its
               low effectiveness. Actually, this critique fades out when one
               looks more closely at what students do in one the popular high
               stake MOOCs: they spend around 25\% of their time watching
               videos, versus 75\% doing the assignments defined by the teacher.
               Therefore, despite the lecturing component, an xMOOC could bring
               learners along rich problem solving or guided discovery
               activities that would have comfort Piaget. The bottle does not
               make the wine. Could the constructivist MOOCs become the agenda
               of learning sciences? Should learning sciences stay away from
               MOOCs or, conversely, go on board and try to influence their
               evolution? This session will include 5 short presentations
               followed by a debate with the audience. Many of the discussions
               about MOOCS are based on economic perspectives and technology
               perspectives. Very few contributions analyze MOOCs from a
               learning science perspective and put them into a larger context
               with other approaches to learning and education. My contribution
               will postulate that MOOCs represent one approach in a rich
               landscape of learning. I will use two specific frames of
               reference (" learning about and learning to be " and " learning
               when the answer is known and is not known ") to analyze the

                  assumptions and studies of educational dialogue through a
                  focus on Bakhtin’s ‘dialogic’. The term dialogic is frequently
                  appropriated to a modernist framework of assumptions, in
                  particular the neo-Vygotskian or sociocultural tradition.
                  However, Vygotsky’s theory of education is dialectic, not
                  dialogic. From a dialogic perspective the difference between
                  voices in dialogue is constitutive of meaning in such a way
                  that it makes no sense to imagine ‘overcoming’ this
                  difference. By contrast, due to the implicit assumption that
                  meaning is ultimately grounded on identity rather than upon
                  difference, the dialectic perspective applied by Vygotsky
                  interprets differences as ‘contradictions’ that need to be
                  overcome or transcended. A case study of research on
                  exploratory talk is used to illustrate the potential for a
                  fruitful relationship between ‘high level’ theory and research

  abstract  = {The earliest educational software simply transferred print
               material from the page to the monitor. Since then, the Internet
               and other digital media have brought students an ever-expanding,
               low-cost knowledge base and the opportunity to interact with
               minds around the globe—while running the risk of shortening their
               attention spans, isolating them from interpersonal contact, and
               subjecting them to information overload.The New Science of
               Learning: Cognition, Computers and Collaboration in Education
               deftly explores the multiple relationships found among these
               critical elements in students' increasingly complex and
               multi-paced educational experience, Starting with instructors'
               insights into the cognitive effects of digital media—a diverse
               range of viewpoints with little consensus—this cutting-edge
               resource acknowledges the double-edged potential inherent in
               computer-based education and its role in shaping students'
               thinking capabilities.The New Science of Learning: Cognition,
               Computers and Collaboration in Education brings emerging
               challenges and innovative ideas into sharp focus for researchers
               in educational psychology, instructional design, education
               technologies, and the learning sciences."The book brings together
               leading researchers who study how technology can enhance student
               learning. They address questions of how technology can support
               collaborative learning, knowledge building, assessment,
               metacognition, and professional development. For example, a
               chapter by Howard Gardner and his colleagues describes how
               students are changing as they grow up with new technologies, and
               a chapter by Kurt W. Fischer and his colleagues describes
               redesigning testing with the use of latest in computer technology
               and learning science. Altogether it is a fine collection of
               chapters about the latest advances in educational
               technology.""Modern learning technologies have emerged in the
               21st century as powerful tools to enhance learning and thinking,
               but much of their potential remains to be realized. Remarkably,
               as we explore how learners interact with diverse learning
               environments, including digital media, we are discovering that
               these tools also are revealing new insights into how our minds
               operate and how better to realize the promise that learning
               technologies offer. This book presents some of the latest
               discoveries and theoretical insights about how we think and
               learn. especially through explorations employing digital media.
               This is a first-class book containing chapters by some of the
               best researchers worldwide."O. R. Anderson, Columbia University,

                  and cultural practices have struggled with ways in which to
                  design studies that can account for the digital aspect of
                  cultural practices while also taking into account that those
                  digital practices do not exist as separate (or separable in
                  terms of our research) from other social and cultural
                  practices. As such, one of the primary and ongoing challenges
                  facing internet-based ethnographic research is the question of
                  how to construct the location of a project when the sites,
                  technologically-mediated practices, and people we study exist
                  and flow through a wider information ecology that is neither
                  fixed nor can easily be located as “online” or “offline.” This
                  is as much a methodological challenge as a theoretical one. If
                  one accepts that a rigid distinction between online and
                  offline makes little theoretical sense, then drawing a
                  methodological line between online and offline only reifies
                  such a dualism. While there is a developing body of
                  internet-related ethnographic literature which is attempting
                  to take into account the fluid nature of our information
                  ecology (e.g. Burrell 2009, Leander and McKim 2003, Hine
                  2007), we continue to operate on shifting ground. This article
                  uses the case of my own work on city-specific discussion
                  forums in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to highlight the
                  complexities of locating digital ethnographic work and also
                  argue for the necessity of accounting for both movement and
                  placed-ness.},

                  have provided new avenues for self-expression, connectivity
                  and ‘self-creation’ among young people, but few pay due
                  attention to geographical and cultural variations. This
                  article takes up the Japanese case by analysing how its youths
                  engage with SNS, like MySpace and Mixi, within a framework of
                  ‘audience engagement’ that encompasses the multiple dimensions
                  of audience activities. Drawing on an ethnography of Japanese
                  youths living in the media-rich Tokyo Metropolitan Area, this
                  article discusses the following four dimensions of audience
                  engagement: information-seeking activity, connectivity,
                  bricolage and participation.While it is neither all about me
                  in MySpace nor all about us in Mixi, it is suggested that
                  MySpace is about me and them and Mixi is about me with them.
                  Japanese young people reflexively create and re-create
                  themselves in everyday life with to-ing and fro-ing in the

  abstract     = {Educational technology research has passed through a number of
                  stages, fo- cusing, in turn, on the content to be learned, the
                  format of instructional mes- sages, and the interaction
                  between computers and students. The field is now concerned
                  with the study of learning in complete, complex, and
                  interactive learning environments. These environments allow
                  both the simulation of experiences that students might have in
                  the real world and also the creation of compelling experiences
                  that cannot normally be experienced directly. Learn- ing
                  environments also often allow students to communicate their
                  own ideas with the use of a variety of symbol systems. These
                  environments are also fre- quently inhabited by more than one
                  person, making learning within them a social activity where
                  learning is distributed among both people and artifacts.
                  Finally, these learning environments are complex. Studying how
                  they con- tribute to learning therefore requires research
                  methods other than controlled experiments. This paper reviews
                  research on learning environments to give both an historical
                  perspective on educational technology research and a se-
                  lective view of the current state of the discipline. It
                  concludes by identifying implications for both practice and

                  suggested as a powerful tool to support their practice and
                  continuing professional development. To further articulate how
                  and why blogs can provide teachers with unique opportunities
                  for identity work, I examine the blog of "Ms. Frizzle," one
                  reform-minded urban middle school science teacher and
                  exceptional blogger. Four recurring features of her blogging,
                  which are all critical elements of identity work, are
                  identified and analyzed: (a) constructing stories of
                  multifaceted aspects of science teaching that are often in
                  tension with one another; (b) simultaneously supporting and
                  being supported by a professional community that spanned
                  traditional boundaries; (c) trying on and developing a variety
                  of interrelated professional sub-identities; and (d)
                  positioning herself centrally within a larger professional
                  discourse. Various forms of investment that were instrumental
                  to Ms. Frizzle's identity work through blogging are also
                  identified and discussed.},

               technology is used to promote connections: between one learner
               and other learners; between learners and tutors and between a
               learning community and its learning resources. Informed by theory
               this book provides insights into the growing area of educational
               practice that is covered by the term networked learning. The
               collection is written in a way that is accessible and useful for
               both researchers and practitioners. Written by experienced
               European researchers the chapters in this collection represent a
               major contribution to the development of a body of research
               evidence in the field. The collection is the outcome of a
               research team that was funded by the European Union as part of
               the Kaleidoscope Network of Excellence. The range of topics and
               the theoretical development of ideas in the collection
               demonstrate the vibrancy of the research community that has
               developed in the area of networked learning. Whilst the chapters
               are always rooted in practice they also contribute to a complex
               understanding of the changes that are taking place in education
               at a time when digital networks have become an essential part of
               the learning environment. This volume will prove valuable for

                  teaching from her first year at university, her field
                  experience, and through her first year of teaching. Several
                  kinds of data were collected over a period of 5 years through
                  different sources: interviews, journal entries, drawing
                  assignments, biographical assignments, lesson plans, and
                  classroom observations. Grounded within a combined theoretical
                  framework of identity and narrative, these data were analyzed
                  by means of open coding techniques. The findings of the data
                  analysis are presented under the following four main
                  themes—(a) discourse identity: embracing and enacting
                  scientific inquiry; (b) affinity identity: the impact of
                  relationships and science learning experiences; (c) nature

  abstract     = {Accompanying the emergence of blog technology as a dominant
                  online publishing paradigm is a growing interest in its
                  educational benefits and applications. This study sets out to
                  develop an empirically grounded framework for educational
                  blogging in the context of teacher education. A working
                  framework was first proposed that highlights four areas:
                  self-expression, self-reflection, social interaction, and
                  reflective dialogue. An exploratory study was then conducted
                  to examine the framework by involving two groups of student
                  teachers during their teaching practice. This study revealed
                  that the salient values of blogs centered on emotionally
                  charged and social-oriented individual expressions as well as
                  self-reflection. The interactive functionality of blogs was
                  used mostly for exchanging social support rather than
                  reflective dialogue. A new dimension – blog-reading – has
                  emerged through the investigation and been added to the
                  original framework. The findings can contribute to a better
                  understanding of the educational values of blogs and their
                  meaningful applications as educational media.},

  abstract     = {Increasingly, teacher leadership is being recognized as an
                  essential ingredient in education reforms; however, few
                  teachers consider themselves leaders. Becoming a leader is not
                  just acquiring knowledge and skills for leadership, but
                  developing a new professional identity. As teachers become
                  leaders, however, this identity might put them at risk with
                  dominant school culture where norms of egalitarianism,
                  isolation, and seniority persist. Luehmann emphasizes the
                  value in offering safe spaces in which teachers can take risks
                  as they “try on” new identities. We utilized an online
                  environment to support ninth-grade science teachers in the
                  development of common perspectives, commitments, and visions
                  for teacher leadership as they implemented a new freshman
                  physics curriculum. Our findings illustrate the potential
                  benefits of blogging in terms of providing identity resources
                  and opportunities for identity work. Specifically, by
                  participating in pedagogical transactions, social
                  interactions, and intellectual deliberations via blogs,
                  teachers were supported in their efforts to be leaders in

                  approach for illuminating learning on a discursive level,
                  i.e., how discourses change and how individuals become
                  participants of new practices. Our approach involves a
                  high-resolution analysis of how meaningful relations are built
                  in encounters between individuals and between individuals and
                  the world. The approach is based mainly on the work of the
                  later Wittgenstein, but also on pragmatism and sociocultural
                  research. To demonstrate how our approach can be used, we
                  analyze what university students learn during a practical on
                  insects. We specifically demonstrate how the encounters with
                  physical pinned insects contribute to the meaning students
                  make and how these encounters interact with other experiences

                  during internship due to its associated usefulness in
                  collaborative learning, reflection, communication, and social
                  support. In this study, blogging was incorporated into the
                  internship activities of two discipline-specific groups of
                  interns: information management (n = 53) and nursing (n = 28).
                  In examining the behavior, perceptions and processes of
                  blogging among interns from the two disciplines, a
                  mixed-methods design was used to obtain quantitative and
                  qualitative data through structured interviews and blogging
                  entries. Results revealed that the interns engaged regularly
                  in the writing and reading of their own blogs, and commented
                  on others' blog-writing. The interns perceived blogs to be
                  useful during internship in providing an avenue for knowledge
                  construction, problem solving, reflection, and communicating
                  their emotions. Positive perceptions were not influenced by
                  discipline background, frequency of use, or blogging platform.
                  Qualitative analyses of blog contents indicated that the
                  students engaged in cognitive, metacognitive-reflective,
                  affective, and social-collaborative learning processes in
                  blogging. Higher engagement was found in cognitive and
                  metacognitive processes. Responses to open-ended probes
                  suggest that pedagogical factors (e.g., grading system,
                  supervision) may also have influenced students' blogging
                  behaviors and perceptions. Overall, this study offers evidence
                  to support the use of blogging during internship as
                  computer-based support for learning. ?? 2011 Published by

                  outlined by professional organizations within the constraints
                  of traditional school. Engaging science learners as a
                  community who collaboratively and creatively co-construct
                  scientific understanding through inquiry requires teachers to
                  adopt new tools as well as a different mindset about the kind
                  of classroom culture they need to nurture. Classroom blogs
                  (i.e., blogs that are managed by a teacher for his/her
                  students to post their work and exchange ideas) have been
                  purported in the literature as offering unique opportunities
                  to achieve this goal, although with little empirical support
                  thus far. To fill this gap, nine classroom blogs were selected
                  through an extensive search, and systematically analyzed to
                  determine how the teachers’ instructional designs and
                  classrooms’ enactment were able to capitalize on the specific
                  affordances blogging may offer to support reform-based
                  learning goals. The shift in teacher mindset needed to realize
                  blogging affordances occurred as teachers engaged with
                  students in the process of ‘living’ the classroom blog.

                  teachers model this process of information analysis and

                  collaboration, professional development, and studying
                  pedagogical techniques and best practices. Many teachers have
                  extended their learning by developing online professional
                  learning networks (PLNs). PLNs connect teachers to other
                  individuals worldwide who can offer support, advice, feedback,
                  and collaboration opportunities. PLNs also allow teachers to
                  collect information from various Web sites and access it in
                  one organized area so they can efficiently stay up to date on
                  the latest teaching techniques, pedagogies, and changes in the

                  research conducted over the past 10 years that has modeled and
                  promoted students' reasoning, conceptual change and
                  argumentative dialogue processes and practices through
                  designing a number of digital dialogue games. This line of
                  work was inspired by some challenges and insights that emerged
                  during projects dealing with conceptual change in science.
                  Since then, the dialogical and pedagogical requirements for
                  improved reasoning, knowledge development and conceptual
                  understanding in a range of contexts have been addressed
                  through projects that have designed and evaluated intelligent
                  and highly interactive dialogue game tools, such as CoLLeGE
                  (Computer-based Laboratory for Language Games in Education),
                  AcademicTalk and InterLoc (Collaborative Interaction through
                  scaffolding Locutions). This article will review this line of
                  work through justifying and describing the rationale for its
                  trajectory before presenting ongoing work that synthesizes and
                  operationalizes its findings and insights. The ongoing work
                  emphasizes an inclusive and personalized approach to learning
                  dialogue that stimulates reasoning, collaborative thinking and
                  the development of argumentative dialogue practices. This is
                  arguably relevant to most learning contexts, and especially to
                  contemporary science education. Finally, conclusions are drawn
                  about the role of dialogue in learning in the digital age.},

               interaction with people and artifacts in the context of everyday
               activity. Acting with Technology makes the case for activity
               theory as a basis for understanding our relationship with
               technology. Victor Kaptelinin and Bonnie Nardi describe activity
               theory's principles, history, relationship to other theoretical
               approaches, and application to the analysis and design of
               technologies. The book provides the first systematic entry-level

               describes the accumulating body of work in interaction design
               informed by activity theory, drawing on work from an
               international community of scholars and designers. Kaptelinin and
               Nardi examine the notion of the object of activity, describe its
               use in an empirical study, and discuss key debates in the
               development of activity theory. Finally, they outline current and
               future issues in activity theory, providing a comparative
               analysis of the theory and its leading theoretical competitors
               within interaction design: distributed cognition, actor-network

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a significant proliferation in the
                  number of teaching blogs; however, little has been explored
                  about what motivates teachers to adopt teaching blogs. The
                  purpose of this study is to find out which factors can
                  significantly influence teacher decisions regarding their
                  teaching blog adoption and the relative importance of these
                  influences. This study extended Rogers’ (1995) Innovation
                  Diffusion Theory (IDT) that incorporates relevant factors from
                  two sources: from within individual IT adoption literature and
                  from within blog research literature emphasizing knowledge
                  sharing motivation. The model includes four dimensions (which
                  are individual, innovation technology, school and
                  environmental characteristics) and 14 factors. A total of 325
                  valid questionnaires were obtained. Discriminant analysis was
                  employed to test the hypotheses. The results revealed that
                  secondary school teachers’ decisions to adopt teaching blogs
                  are strongly associated with eight factors: perceived
                  enjoyment, codification effort, compatibility, perceived ease
                  of use, personal innovativeness, enjoyment in helping others,
                  school support and perceived usefulness, ordered by their
                  relative importance. The research results also have important
                  implications for researchers, secondary school managers and
                  blog services providers.},

                  popular as a means for explaining differences in meaning and

                  self-presentation can be split into performances, which take
                  place in synchronous “situations,” and artifacts, which take
                  place in asynchronous “exhibitions.” Goffman’s dramaturgical
                  approach (including the notions of front and back stage)
                  focuses on situations. Social media, on the other hand,
                  frequently employs exhibitions, such as lists of status
                  updates and sets of photos, alongside situational activities,
                  such as chatting. A key difference in exhibitions is the
                  virtual “curator” that manages and redistributes this digital
                  content. This article introduces the exhibitional approach and
                  the curator and suggests ways in which this approach can
                  extend present work concerning online presentation of self. It
                  introduces a theory of “lowest common denominator” culture
                  employing the exhibitional approach.},

                  more than adult education or training — it is a mindset and a
                  habit for people to acquire. It creates the challenge to

                  (3) informal learning, and (4) organizational learning.
                  Lifelong learning requires a deeper understanding of the
                  co-evolutionary processes between fundamental human activities
                  and their relationships with new media. It requires an
                  integration of new theories, innovative systems, practices,

                  organizational forms, and reward structures need to be created
                  to make lifelong learning an important part of human life.
                  These new spaces and structures must support individuals,
                  groups, and organizations who will engage in and experience
                  them as innovators and risk takers, and will use their

  title    = {The effect of roles on computer-supported collaborative learning},
  author   = {Strijbos, Jan-Willem},
  pages    = {244},
  date     = {2004},
  abstract = {Roles 1.7 The use of roles to sustain CSCL One approach to enlarge
              the students urge to actively engage in a group process is to
              provide students with pedagogical support or a specific type of
              pre-structuring such as the use of roles. This is often also
              referred to as scripting (Dillenbourg 2002; Weinberger, 2003).
              Roles can be defined as more or less stated functions, job, duties
              or responsibilities that guide individual behaviour and regulate
              intragroup interaction (Hare, 1994). Roles promote group cohesion
              and responsibility (Mudrack \& Farrell, 1995). Group cohesion
              tends to increase stability, satisfaction and efficient
              communication (Shaw, 1981; Forsyth, 1999) and a greater sense of
              responsibility tends to increase group performance. Cohesion and
              responsibility can be used to foster positive interdependence and
              individual accountability (Brush, 1998), which are central
              concepts in group-based learning. Positive interdependence refers
              to the degree to which the performance of a single group member
              depends on the performance of all other members (Johnson, 1981).
              Individual accountability refers to the extent to which group
              members are held individually accountable for jobs, tasks or
              duties, central to group performance or efficiency (Slavin, 1981).
              The use of roles appears to be most relevant when a group pursues
              a shared goal that requires a certain level of task division,
              coordination, and integration of individual activities. Three main
              categories of roles can be distinguished: individual roles, task
              roles, and maintenance roles. Each of these categories is composed
              of several different roles (Mudrack \& Farrell, 1995). However,
              these roles are based on a self-report inventory and pertain to
              roles that participants can perform during collaboration.
              Moreover, each participant performs several roles simultaneously,
              thus making it difficult to implement such roles in educational
              contexts. Nevertheless, these role descriptions can guide the
              design of roles for pedagogical purposes.},

  abstract     = {The theory of the organism-environment system starts with the
                  proposition that in any functional sense organism and
                  environment are inseparable and form only one unitary system.
                  The organism cannot exist without the environment, and the
                  environment has descriptive properties only if it is connected
                  to the organism. Although for practical purposes we do
                  separate organism and environment, this common-sense starting
                  point leads in psychological theory to problems which cannot
                  be solved. Therefore, separation of organism and environment
                  cannot be the basis of any scientific explanation of human
                  behavior. The theory leads to a reinterpretation of basic
                  problems in many fields of inquiry and makes possible the
                  definition of mental phenomena without their reduction either
                  to neural or biological activity or to separate mental
                  functions. According to the theory, mental activity is
                  activity of the whole organism-environment system, and the
                  traditional psychological concepts describe only different
                  aspects of organization of this system. Therefore, mental
                  activity cannot be separated from the nervous system, but the
                  nervous system is only one part of the organism-environment
                  system. This problem will be dealt with in detail in the
                  second part of the article.},

                  learning) is intimately connected with and dependent on the
                  human cognitive system. Learning means that the cognitive
                  system acquires information and stores it for further use. If
                  these processes do not occur properly, then the learners will
                  not initially acquire the information, and even if they do,
                  then they will not be able to recall it later, or/and the
                  information will not be utilised and behaviour will not be
                  modified. Regardless whether the objective is learning new
                  information (e.g., compliance regulations, product
                  specifications, etc.), acquiring new skills (e.g., operating a
                  new apparatus, customer service, time management, etc.), or
                  knowledge sharing and transfer within or across organisations
                  — the processes of acquiring, storing and applying the
                  information are critical. The question is how to achieve these
                  cornerstones of learning and whether technology can enhance
                  them. The answer is clear: The learning must fit human
                  cognition. There is a lot of scientific knowledge and research
                  on human cognition and learning. The difficult and tricky
                  challenge is how to translate this theoretical and academic
                  research into practical ways to utilise technology so as to
                  enhance learning. By bridging basic research about learning
                  and the brain into ways of using learning technologies, one is
                  able to create sophisticated learning programs. These take
                  into account and build on the architecture of cognition, and
                  as a consequence produce effective and efficient technology
                  enhanced learning.},

               technologies. Our findings illustrate the importance of
               discerning availability and willingness to video conference prior
               to calling, the need to share everyday life activities in
               addition to conversation, and a need for new privacy protecting

                  in schools and higher education institutions, and they are
                  widely promoted as collaborative tools supporting students'
                  active learning. However, literature review on educational
                  blogging revealed a lack of a complete and consistent
                  framework for studying and assessing students' engagement and
                  the impact of blogging on students' learning. This study
                  reports on the application of an analysis framework for
                  evaluating blogging learning activities, based on two
                  well‐documented models, those of Community of Inquiry (CoI)
                  and Social Network Analysis . The framework proposed is
                  examined through an empirical study involving 21 K‐9 students,
                  coming from two classes, in Greece. This investigation shed
                  light into the different ways of students' engagement in a

                  that supported the development of a CoI and learning. The
                  results suggest that the students, through their different

                  Internet to improve their skills, knowledge, and practice. The
                  Internet may be a practical alternative for providing
                  high-quality, research-based training, information, and
                  resources to these professionals. When designing online
                  materials and Web sites, however, it is important to first
                  assess early childhood professionals' needs so that the
                  materials and experience can be designed to best meet those
                  needs. The current, multistate study was designed to address
                  three questions: (1) How do early childhood professionals
                  currently use the Internet? (2) What features do early
                  childhood professionals most prefer in a Web site designed
                  especially for them? and (3) Do preferences for specific types
                  of features vary depending on characteristics such as age,
                  education, experience, and comfort with the Internet? Eight
                  hundred sixteen early childhood professionals in three regions
                  of the United States (Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada) completed
                  a brief questionnaire regarding their preferences and
                  experiences with online professional development. Respondents
                  were most likely to use the Internet for email and to access
                  it for both professional and personal reasons. Respondents
                  were most interested in being able to download learning
                  activities and curricula, access online training and classes,
                  obtain materials to give to parents, and ask questions of
                  experts. The information from this study should be useful for
                  educators currently involved in providing online educational
                  opportunities, as well as those educators considering offering

                  media use and learning activities undertaken by employees. It
                  was expected that social media use relates to higher levels of
                  learning and that this relationship is stronger when employees
                  perceive higher levels of an organization culture that
                  stimulates dialogue and inquiry. A total of 590 respondents of
                  three multinationals based in the Netherlands completed a
                  survey. As expected, results showed that the more often
                  employees used social media in their job, the more often they
                  participated in learning activities. Contrary to expectation,
                  this relationship was not influenced by culture of dialogue
                  and inquiry. Instead, the perception of a culture of dialogue
                  and inquiry directly related to learning on the job. The
                  findings suggest that organizations could consider stimulating
                  the use of social media among employees to support
                  work‐related learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA,

                  limitations in existing research approaches severely hamper
                  theory building and empirical exploration of teacher learning
                  and collaboration through cyber-enabled networks. They
                  conclude that new frameworks, tools, and techniques are needed
                  to understand and maximize the benefits of teacher networks.
                  The paper presents preliminary data to illuminate both the
                  power and limitations of current tools and techniques for
                  studying cyber-enabled networks using data from a large,
                  mature online network of K-12 educators. The findings raise
                  fundamental questions that are beyond the capability of most
                  education researchers and evaluators to address rigorously and
                  cost- effectively. The authors propose a research agenda
                  designed to create and validate a new generation of research
                  tools and techniques that enable researchers ask more incisive
                  and convergent research questions and help school leaders and
                  teachers support, learn, and collaborate with one another more
                  effectively in cyber-enabled professional communities.

  abstract     = {Abstract The purpose of this article is to offer some
                  reflections on the relationships between digital technologies
                  and learning. It is argued that activities of learning, as
                  they have been practised within institutionalized schooling,
                  are coming under increasing pressure from the developments of
                  digital technologies and the capacities to store, access and
                  manipulate information that such resources offer. Thus, the
                  technologies do not merely support learning; they transform
                  how we learn and how we come to interpret learning. The
                  metaphors of learning currently emerging as relevant in the
                  new media ecology emphasize the transformational and
                  performative nature of such activities, and of knowing in
                  general. These developments make the hybrid nature of human
                  knowing and learning obvious; what we know and master is, to
                  an increasing extent, a function of the mediating tools we are
                  familiar with. At a theoretical and practical level, this
                  implies that the interdependences between human agency, minds,
                  bodies and technologies have to serve as foundations when
                  attempting to understand and improve learning. Attempts to
                  account for what people know without integrating their mastery
                  of increasingly sophisticated technologies into the picture
                  will lack ecological validity.},

               is an important task that falls outside the domain of
               applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking
               tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
               program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and
               systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing
               Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of
               the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based
               implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among
               the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤
               2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with
               default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide
               sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the
               native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the
               recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for
               these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
               Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an
               unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\%
               of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and
               find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for
               extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges,
               defining a domain of applicability for this approach.}

                  ecological approach to perception and learning to gameplay,
                  the article describes gaming as a perception-action cycle,
                  i.e., an interplay between seeing and using affordances. This
                  notion of how gameplay fanctions is then used in arder to
                  discuss different design features in games, and it is claimed
                  that games can be designed so that players are able to
                  discover and utilize affordances without always having to
                  develop skills and knowledge. Compared to many other
                  practices, gaming can be less demanding and not as complex,
                  since progress can be built into the game system. Previous

                  multi-method design was employed by collecting quantitative
                  data from 616 teachers with a Facebook account using an online
                  questionnaire and qualitative data from 32 teachers using

                  that Facebook seems to be part of teachers’ daily routines.
                  Moreover, they revealed that teachers were less likely to
                  share sensitive and potentially stigmatising personal
                  information on Facebook. Teachers were also found to set most
                  of their Facebook privacy settings as “Friends” by taking
                  intimacy, unwanted contacts and potential threats into
                  consideration. Furthermore, the findings indicated that
                  teachers felt themselves less comfortable when parents and
                  students viewed their Facebook profiles. In addition to social

                  dynamic and makes great demands on those trying to seize the
                  opportunities presented by emerging technologies. The goal of
                  this paper is to explore certain theories for our plans and
                  actions in technology-enabled learning. Although presented as
                  a successor to previous learning theories, connectivism alone
                  is insufficient to inform learning and its support by
                  technology in an internetworked world. However, because of its
                  presence in massive open online courses (MOOCs), connectivism
                  is influential in the practice of those who take these courses
                  and who wish to apply it in teaching and learning. Thus
                  connectivism is perceived as relevant by its practitioners but
                  as lacking in rigour by its critics. Five scenarios of change
                  are presented with frameworks of different theories to explore
                  the variety of approaches educators can take in the contexts
                  for change and their associated research/evaluation. I argue
                  that the choice of which theories to use depends on the scope
                  and purposes of the intervention, the funding available to
                  resource the research/evaluation, and the experience and
                  philosophical stances of the researchers/practitioners.},

                  e-learning initiative to attain widespread popularity among
                  many universities. In this paper, a review of the current
                  published literature focusing on the use of MOOCs by
                  instructors or students was conducted. Our primary goal in
                  doing this is to summarize the accumulated state of knowledge
                  concerning the main motivations and challenges of using MOOCs,
                  as well as to identify issues that have yet to be fully
                  addressed or resolved. Our findings suggest four reasons why
                  students sign up for MOOCs: the desire to learn about a new
                  topic or to extend current knowledge, they were curious about
                  MOOCs, for personal challenge, and the desire to collect as
                  many completion certificates as possible. Up to 90\% drop out
                  due to reasons including a lack of incentive, failure to
                  understand the content material and having no one to turn to
                  for help, and having other priorities to fulfill. Findings
                  suggest three main reasons why instructors wish to teach
                  MOOCs: being motivated by a sense of intrigue, the desire to
                  gain some personal (egoistic) rewards, or a sense of altruism.
                  Four key challenges of teaching MOOCs are also surfaced:
                  difficulty in evaluating students’ work, having a sense of
                  speaking into a vacuum due to the absence of student immediate
                  feedback, being burdened by the heavy demands of time and
                  money, and encountering a lack of student participation in
                  online forums. We conclude by discussing two issues that have
                  yet to be fully resolved – the quality of MOOC education, and
                  the assessment of student work.},

                  Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of these online
                  courses in engaging participants in the learning process. This
                  study explores the range of pedagogical tools used in 24
                  MOOCs, including the epistemological and social dimensions of
                  instruction, to consider the extent to which these courses
                  provide students with high-quality, collaborative learning
                  experiences. Findings suggest that the range of pedagogical
                  practices currently used in MOOCs tends toward an
                  objectivist-individual approach, with some efforts to
                  incorporate more constructivist and group-oriented approaches.
                  By examining MOOCs through the lens of engaged teaching and
                  learning, this study raises concerns about the degree to which
                  MOOCs are actually revolutionizing higher education by using
                  technology to improve quality, and challenges educators to

                  discussed in various disciplines? The paper offers a critical
                  examination of the practical and policy implications of
                  reconsidering scholarship in light of social media’s
                  affordances toward a conceptualization of social scholarship.
                  For each dimension of Boyer’s original framework, we explain
                  its epistemologies and practices. Next, we take a critical
                  approach to inquiring how each dimension, reconsidered through
                  the lens of social scholarship values and social media
                  affordances, might be envisioned today. This exploration
                  provides concrete examples of how scholars might enact social
                  scholarship with what beneﬁts and challenges.},

                  highly on organisation and presentation of course material.
                  The results indicate that although most MOOCs are

                  enables new spaces for communication; the impact on learning,
                  however, is not yet acknowledged in education. The aim of this
                  exploratory case study is to scrutinize how students frame
                  their interaction in social networking sites (SNS) in school
                  practices and what that implies for educational language
                  teaching and learning practices. Analytically, the study
                  departs from a sociocultural perspective on learning, and
                  adopts conceptual distinctions of frame analysis. The results
                  based on ethnographic data from a Facebook group in
                  English-learning classes, with 60 students aged between 13 and
                  16 from Colombia, Finland, Sweden and Taiwan indicate that
                  there is a possibility for boundary crossing, which could
                  generate extended spaces for collaborative language-learning
                  activities in educational contexts where students combine
                  their school subject of learning language and their
                  communicative use of language in their everyday life. Such
                  extended spaces are, however, difficult to maintain and have
                  to be recurrently negotiated. To take advantage of young
                  people's various dynamic communicative uses of language in
                  their everyday life in social media, the implementation of
                  such media for educational purposes has to be deliberately,
                  collaboratively and dynamically negotiated by educators and
                  students to form a new language-learning space with its own
                  potentials and constraints. © 2013 International Society of

                  main perspectives to influence this social learning framework.
                  The review exercise resulted in four dimensions: (1) practice,
                  (2) domain and value creation, (3) collective identity and (4)

                  questions regarding the construction of virtual learning
                  environments and course delivery systems. One such question
                  that researchers and instructors alike are considering is the
                  role of community in learning spaces. This paper uses a
                  professional development (PD) MOOC as a case study to
                  investigate whether students identified as a community and
                  identify characteristics that encourage students to believe
                  this is so. Furthermore, the authors question if
                  ''community,'' specifically ''communities of practice,'' is
                  actually the appropriate way to describe such learning spaces,

               ideally placed at the Open Universiteit of the Nether- lands

               somewhat off the beaten track; most initiatives (by other well
               respected centres) deal with formal teacher training. As we shall
               demonstrate later on, however, it is important for informal

  abstract     = {This review of research explores characteristics associated
                  with massive open online courses (MOOCs). Three key
                  characteristics are revealed: varied definitions of openness,
                  barriers to persistence, and a distinct structure that takes
                  the form as one of two pedagogical approaches. The concept of
                  openness shifts among different MOOCs, models, researchers,
                  and facilitators. The high dropout rates show that the
                  barriers to learning are a significant challenge. Research has
                  focused on engagement, motivation, and presence to mitigate
                  risks of learner isolation. The pedagogical structure of the
                  connectivist MOOC model (cMOOC) incorporates a social,
                  distributed, networked approach and significant learner
                  autonomy that is geared towards adult lifelong learners
                  interested in personal or professional development. This
                  connectivist approach relates to situated and social learning
                  theories such as social constructivism (Kop, 2011). By
                  contrast, the design of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
                  (AI) model (xMOOC) uses conventional directed instruction in
                  the context of formal postsecondary educational institutions.
                  This traditional pedagogical approach is categorized as
                  cognitive-behaviorist (Rodriguez, 2012). These two distinct
                  MOOC models attract different audiences, use different
                  learning approaches, and employ different teaching methods.
                  The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research
                  describing the phenomenon of MOOCs in informal and
                  postsecondary online learning.}

                  investigates the efficacy of Twitter as a medium for teachers
                  to participate in professional learning by analysing the
                  tweets of 30 influential users of the popular medium. We find
                  that Twitter primarily acts as a valuable conduit for

                  internet and also as a viable means of social support for
                  like-minded educators. The cost effective nature of the

                  studying with print material. Design/methodology/approach – At
                  the end of seven months study, final test results for company
                  certification were collected and analyzed. Additionally,
                  quantitative and qualitative data from the 59 employees’
                  individual learning experiences were obtained to address the
                  research questions. Findings – The paper finds that the first
                  year’s experiences of using e-learning course were mostly
                  positive. The results showed that participants learning online
                  gained similar or slightly better learning outcomes than those
                  who used the print material. Those learning online earned the
                  certificate in less time in comparison with those studying the
                  print version. Research limitations/implications – The present
                  study is limited by its small and potentially
                  non-representative sample, representing those who voluntarily
                  participated to work towards the in-house qualification.
                  Practical implications – The practical implications of the
                  results include integrating e-learning into the real workplace
                  environment. When enough attention is paid to the course
                  design, e-learning provides good possibilities for effective
                  use of employee time. The work has relevance for other
                  corporate training providers considering incorporating
                  e-learning into their professional development programs.
                  Originality/value – Not many companies who have moved
                  traditionally delivered programs online, have been able to
                  compare groups of employees who have studied from text-based
                  material with those who have taken the online version. Two
                  separate research processes implemented provided a unique
                  opportunity to analyze work-based learning outcomes.},

                  comes to sharing knowledge about their professions. In the

                  networks, email listservs, and blogging connections to share
                  knowledge and resources. Here, I describe how one teacher

                  local and global, tied into their school settings, districts,

                  engage multiple methods, including qualitative interviews and
                  observations and quantitative social network analyses of
                  Sylvia’s Facebook network. Analysis of Sylvia’s practices and
                  digital networks reveals the degree to which teachers’

                  teacher education course taught by the author. The

                  semester, after which a survey was conducted to explore
                  whether they had continued to use Twitter for professional
                  purposes and why or why not. In reflections upon the fall
                  semester’s experience, preservice teachers noted several

                  support of resource sharing, communication, and connection

                  so to gather teaching resources. The majority of participants
                  maintained a positive opinion of Twitter’s educational
                  potential and indicated intentions to utilize it for

                While higher education institutions are responding to an

                understanding optimal use of, and interaction with new Web 2.0
                capabilities is a pressing area of concern among academics.
                Limited studies are available on how and why teachers in higher

                  discourse. The discourse centers on the role of social media
                  and its utility in the teaching and learning environment.
                  Several arguments have been made to support its use because
                  they are highly collaborative, easily accessible, and provide
                  opportunities to embed a variety of Web 2.0 tools such as
                  blogs, wikis, and online chats. However, there is a dearth in
                  research on teacher use of educational social networking sites
                  (SNS) in Trinidad and Tobago. The purpose of this study was to
                  explore how 35 secondary school teachers in Trinidad and
                  Tobago participated in an educational online social networking
                  site. This study utilized a mixed methods exploratory approach
                  and allowed for the use of online data capture together with
                  questionnaires and interviews. Combined data analysis revealed
                  five different levels of site participation, with most
                  teachers adopting the role of content consumer rather than of
                  content producer. Barriers to participation were time,
                  motivation, technology, and usability. The designed social
                  networking site allowed teachers to make public their
                  discourse on their practice while connecting with colleagues
                  from other schools. The study was qualitative dominant, with
                  the mixed methods research approach allowing for deeper
                  exploration of teachers’ participation on this social
                  networking website, and was justified by the newness and
                  transient nature of data from social networking websites.},

                  characteristics of this network, to draw conclusions about who
                  belongs to this network, and to explore what the network

                  offer advice, and provide social and emotional support to each

                  related to higher education that use similar hashtags to
                  congregate. \#PhDchat demonstrates that (a) the network is in

                  teachers in instructional inquiry over an extended time
                  through collaborative professional learning communities (PLCs)
                  is effective in improving instruction and student achievement.
                  Still, most professional development is offered as
                  short-duration workshops that are not effective in changing
                  practice. Barriers to the implementation of PLCs include lack
                  of shared meeting time and a shortage of teachers who share
                  the same subject areas or common goals and interests.
                  Convening teachers from multiple districts can alleviate this
                  problem, but teachers are reluctant to travel for meetings due
                  to time and cost restraints. Video-conferencing software
                  offers a solution to these barriers while serving to foster
                  the sense of community needed for PLCs to be effective. The
                  researchers describe the use of Virtual PLCs in which two
                  groups of teachers met monthly for one school year to
                  collaboratively analyze evidence collected as part of their
                  teacher inquiry plans. With help from a facilitator, these
                  groups developed a relationship similar to other groups
                  meeting face-to-face as part of the same professional
                  development program. Analysis of the reflections of
                  teacher-participants and facilitators revealed that teachers
                  prefer face-to-face meetings, but that the virtual and
                  face-to-face meetings provided teachers with similar social
                  interactions in the PLC experience. The findings suggest that
                  teachers perceive videoconferencing as an effective tool for
                  facilitating PLCs when distance and time are practical
                  barriers to faceto- face meetings. Practical considerations
                  for developing and facilitating virtual PLCs are also
                  discussed.},

                  The paper begins by exploring what is understood by hybrid

                  hybrid methods to investigate the experiences of participants

                  giving examples from several projects that have tried

                  areas: constructivism, situated and distributed cognition, and
                  communities of practice. We first present the theoretical
                  ideas on which this framework is based and discuss two
                  projects that were developed following the framework. We then
                  discuss the lessons learned and present the implications for
                  the design of online professional development. The values of
                  commitment, innovation, assessment, evaluation, communication,
                  and interaction that underpins successful online professional
                  development projects are highlighted. It is argued that using

                  consistent with constructivist learning, and recognizing that

                  interaction - among some members of online communities for
                  teachers is beneficial for all teachers' professional
                  development in the whole community. Earlier research indicated
                  that blended communities tend to face fewer trust and free
                  rider problems. This study continues this stream of research
                  by examining whether blended communities provide more
                  practical benefits to teachers, both in terms of perceived
                  improvements to their teaching capabilities as well as for
                  their substantial understanding of their core topic. In
                  addition, it is tested whether blended communities provide
                  more information about vacancies, as teachers' mobility is
                  regarded as too low in the EU. The analysis uses survey data
                  from 26 online communities for secondary education teachers in
                  The Netherlands. The communities are part of a virtual
                  organization that hosts communities for teachers' professional
                  development. The findings indeed show beneficial effects of
                  blended communities. Moreover, the results modify earlier
                  claims about the integration of online communication with
                  offline interaction by showing that complete integration is
                  unnecessary. This facilitates a scaling up of the use of
                  online communities for teachers' professional development. ??

                  traditional methods of learning consumption. The emergence and
                  use of MOOCs for professional teacher development is still
                  uncommon, but on the verge of gaining a foothold. Research
                  regarding MOOCs typically focuses on impacts for higher
                  education and lifelong learning. However, the specific
                  intersection of MOOCs and professional teacher development is
                  poorly researched. This concept paper contemplates the
                  benefits and drawbacks of using MOOCs for professional teacher
                  development and calls for more practical studies and
                  explorative research. This paper also speculates on the basic
                  MOOC design criteria and principles needed to maximize
                  engagement and course completion, which are currently common
                  issues with general MOOCs. The conclusion is that MOOCs can be
                  a cost-and resource-effective means to deliver quality
                  education in order to further professional teacher
                  development. However, possible risks are employers' reluctance
                  to accept MOOC accreditation as equivalent professional
                  development and the lack of relevant MOOC courses for
                  professional development.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate professional development of teachers in the
                  online context, the online community of practice (CoPs) has
                  become an important platform in which individuals with similar
                  interests or common goals get together to share their
                  resources, develop working strategies, solve problems, and
                  improve individual as well as organizational performance. In
                  this study, we have collected self-reported knowledge-sharing
                  behaviors from 321 members of the largest online professional
                  CoP of teachers in Taiwan. The results show that closer
                  connections among online CoP members can lead to greater
                  recognition of and altruism towards others. Moreover,
                  performance expectation and self-efﬁcacy belief play essential
                  roles in knowledge-sharing participation. Thus, the
                  development of social relationships among online teacher
                  members helps them obtain potential resources and reliable
                  support through their social network. Also, teachers’
                  membership in the online professional CoP fosters a prosocial
                  attitude that heightens their willingness to share useful
                  resources and solve other members’ problems, both emotionally
                  and instrumentally. Consequently, knowledge-sharing behaviors,
                  in terms of knowledge giving and knowing receiving, are
                  signiﬁcantly predicted by prosocial commitment and performance
                  expectation respectively. The implications to both research
                  and practice are provided in this paper.},

  abstract     = {In this article, Larry Cuban discusses his ideas about the
                  topic of this Special Issue of E-learning and Digital Media
                  ‘Networked Realms and Hoped-For Futures: A trans-generational
                  dialogue’ with one of its co-editors, Petar Jandric´. The
                  conversation explores the historical relationships between
                  education and information and communication technologies and
                  draws lessons for present and future. The first part of the
                  conversation explores methodological issues pertaining to
                  historical thinking about schools and computers in the network
                  society. It identifies a continued need to recognize
                  historical patterns, including those in thought experiments,
                  and shows that Rogers’ theory of diffusion of innovations
                  should be supplemented by more nuanced approaches to the
                  historical relationships between schools and computers. The
                  second part of the conversation presents an attempt to explain
                  historical patterns using the ancient notion of magical
                  thinking. It explores why teachers use computers in their
                  private lives much more than in their professional lives, and
                  ‘school anarchy’ caused by student usage of personally owned
                  devices in classrooms. It creates a baseline for comparison
                  between desktop / laptop computers and various hand-held
                  devices, and dismantles the quest for deschooling as another
                  example of magical thinking. The third part of the
                  conversation examines the ideological role of information and
                  communication technologies in contemporary school reform and
                  explores their potential for democracy. It analyses the
                  contemporary transformations of traditional publishing formats
                  such as books, journals and newspapers, and their reflections
                  in the world of academia. It examines the changing role of
                  teachers as public intellectuals, and the role of information
                  and communication technologies in their public exposure. The
                  last part of the conversation analyses the process of
                  ‘educationalizing’ various social and economic problems, and
                  links it to contemporary technologies. It revisits Larry
                  Cuban’s predictions from Teachers and Machines: Classroom Use
                  of Technology Since 1920 (1986), and reminds us that accurate
                  predictions are rare, while inaccurate ones are not only
                  common but often memorable. Finally, it examines why it is so
                  hard to balance education with information and communication
                  technologies.},

  abstract     = {Historically, most schools employ only one music teacher per
                  specialty; therefore, student teachers in music education work
                  in relative isolation during their student teaching
                  experience. Student teachers often have to attend a seminar
                  once a week at their institution during the student teaching
                  experience, yet this is not always the appropriate environment
                  or time for certain questions that arise during student
                  teaching. A space outside of the classroom that is
                  consistently available regardless of location and time would
                  be helpful to student teachers (Hew \& Cheung, 2003b) during
                  their student teaching experience. Additionally, there are few
                  established forums for the professional development of these
                  music student teachers where they can share information and
                  ideas to improve their practice. One of the ways to address
                  the absence of more traditional professional development
                  opportunities for student teachers is to make online forums
                  available to them. However, not enough is known about how
                  student teachers in music education learn to access and make
                  use of such online forums to share reflections, ideas, and
                  concerns important to their practice. Therefore, this study
                  examined how nine student teachers engage in an online
                  community of practice dedicated to them and how this, in turn,
                  impacted their student teaching experience. The data were
                  gathered from interviews, document support, and the Critical
                  Incident Technique, and yielded the following five major
                  findings: all nine participants discussed or alluded to the
                  benefits of a professional working relationship with one's
                  cooperating teacher and how this relationship positively
                  impacted their student teaching achievements; each of the nine
                  participants used The Trading Fours Online Project in
                  different ways and for different reasons; the spectrum of days
                  and times for The Trading Fours Wiki Discussion Board Posts
                  illustrates the benefits of asynchronous online communication
                  for this community; a majority of the posts on the Wiki
                  focused on giving and seeking advice; each participant had
                  his/her own needs throughout the student teaching experience,
                  and these specific needs are illustrative of the individual's
                  use of The Trading Fours Online Project and its impact on him
                  or her as a student teacher.},

                  popularity and certain social network services are already
                  being used for educational purposes. Social network services
                  simulate and may even emulate existing social networks on an

  abstract     = {This qualitative case study is the first phase of a
                  large-scale design-based research project to implement a
                  theoretically derived double-layered CoP model within
                  real-world teacher development practices. The main goal of
                  this first iteration is to evaluate the courses and test and
                  refine the CoP model for future implementations. This paper
                  demonstrates the potential synergies between two major
                  approaches to teacher professional development practices: i)
                  teachers' CoPs development and ii) online teacher education
                  courses. The double-layered CoP model could provide a
                  practical integration of the two approaches by providing
                  student inservice teachers in an online graduate course with
                  meaningful opportunities to participate in two different
                  teachers' CoPs: i) an internal course CoP and ii) an external
                  professional CoP. Our analysis of student inservice teachers'
                  CoPs experiences shows that the two layers of CoPs supported
                  each other iteratively through the course period. Several
                  design considerations for the second iteration of the online
                  course design are also addressed.}

                  professionals, a new space is emerging for teachers to gather
                  and connect with each other. Particularly, the social media
                  landscape has options such as Twitter, where teachers can
                  regularly connect with each other and their own chosen
                  experts. In this paper we use data from \#oklaed TwitterChats,
                  to examine how social media is changing the practice of
                  Teacher Professional Development (TPD). Specifically, we seek
                  to find if Twitter offers an alternative space for TPD. Our
                  findings indicate that the future of professional development
                  in teaching and learning institutions may not hinge only on
                  the institutions choosing when TPD will occur, but in finding
                  ways to incorporate the way teachers use their own
                  Professional Learning Network (PLN) as a source of TPD.},

                  gies, resources, and modes have been implemented in higher
                  education settings for nearly two decades, and research has
                  identified many positive effects. More recently, K-12 tra-
                  ditional and charter schools have begun to experiment with
                  blended learning, but to date, research on the effects of and
                  issues related to blending in these settings has been limited,
                  and the results less clear. In this article, we draw from rel-
                  evant published research, reports, and book chapters from
                  higher education and K-12 to discuss what K-12 teachers should
                  know about blended learning environments. This re- view
                  suggests that effective teacher preparation for blended
                  instruction must integrate three broad components—con-
                  textual, instructional, and technological—each of which is
                  closely aligned with common instructional design processes

                  analysed. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the
                  most recurrent lines of research since the emergence of these
                  tools in education. The level of education in which research
                  is carried out is also analysed, as well as the paradigms and
                  methods used for data collection. The analysis leads to the
                  conclusion that most of the studies analysed have been carried
                  out in higher education, from a quantitative paradigm,
                  focusing on the use of SNS as educational tools. This article

  abstract     = {This paper aims to contribute to teacher professional
                  development (TPD) on ICT by exploring socio-cultural factors
                  such as places, activities and relevant others, which
                  constitute teachers' complete sets of contexts that provide
                  opportunities for learning. This set of contexts is defined as
                  "learning ecology". An important aspect of learning ecology is
                  the development over time of how people cope with their
                  learning environment. By result, analysing a person's learning
                  ecology entails investigating the start and development of
                  teachers' ICT use, related beliefs and attitudes, and relevant
                  others influencing this development. Our research question
                  reads: What lessons can be learnt for TPD on ICT from
                  knowledge of teachers' learning ecology, with an emphasis on
                  sparks of interest, beliefs, relevant others, and pathways of
                  participation? This question is answered by biographical
                  interviews that in a narrative manner map life trajectories
                  related to ICT. Following existing research we opted for ICT
                  minded and non-ICT minded pre-service and in-service teachers.
                  The results show the importance of a number of TPD aspects:
                  siblings and friends for the ignition and development over
                  time of types of ICT-use, the importance of informal learning
                  approaches and development of bridging social capital, and the
                  creation of ICT rich social environments. The biographical
                  interview may serve as a tool to find elements in the
                  narratives such as reflection on ICT use, learning
                  trajectories and resulting pedagogical beliefs, which foster
                  TPD.},

                  qualitative and mixed-method research data, and then drawing
                  conclusions regarding the collective meaning of the research.
                  Qualitative synthesis is regularly used within systematic
                  reviews in the health professions literature, although such
                  use has been heavily debated in the general literature. This
                  controversy arises in part from the inherent tensions found
                  when generalisations are derived from in-depth studies that
                  are heavily context-dependent. Methods We explore three
                  representative qualitative synthesis methodologies: thematic
                  analysis; meta-ethnography, and realist synthesis. These can
                  be understood across two dimensions: integrative to
                  interpretative, and idealist to realist. Three examples are
                  used to illustrate the relative strengths and limitations of
                  these approaches. Discussion Against a backdrop of controversy
                  and diverse methodologies, readers must take a critical stand
                  when reading literature reviews that use qualitative synthesis
                  to derive their findings. We argue that notions of qualitative
                  rigour such as transparency and acknowledgment of the
                  researchers’ stance should be applied to qualitative
                  synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years there has been widespread interest in the
                  implementation of information and communication technologies
                  (ICT) in schools. While most studies primarily focus on the
                  use of ICT in teaching and learning, little attention has been
                  given to their incorporation as a professional tool outside
                  the classroom. Using a digital inequality approach, the aim of
                  this paper is to develop and test a model of the factors that
                  affect teachers' professional use of ICT, particularly the
                  Internet, in primary and secondary schools. One thousand four
                  hundred and five (1405) teachers from a representative sample
                  of 536 primary and 273 secondary schools in Spain were
                  surveyed. The dependent variables include attitudes towards
                  the professional use of ICT and the use of the Internet in
                  professional practice. The explanatory variables are the
                  socio-demographics, school-level information, frequency of
                  Internet access within and outside the school, educational ICT
                  training, digital literacy, and organisational development.
                  Controlling for socio-demographics and school-level
                  information, multiple regression analyses are used to make
                  inferential judgements and test the separate effects of the
                  independent variables. Findings suggest that technological
                  factors and organisational practices are important predictors
                  of ICT appropriation for professional purposes. ?? 2012

                  influence teachers' decisions to use ICT in the classroom:
                  access to resources, quality of software and hardware, ease of
                  use, incentives to change, support and collegiality in their

                  suggests that teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning

                  districts in the United States) undergoing reform is to design
                  systems that facilitate instructional improvement. At the core
                  of these systems are educational infrastructures that bolster
                  capacity building efforts and support teaching and leadership
                  practices. Our goal for this special issue is to apply
                  infrastructure as a framework to understand educational change
                  processes across a variety of contexts and levels of the
                  education system (i.e., state, district, school, classroom).
                  Taken together, the articles in this issue reveal how
                  infrastructure can support and/or constrain educational change
                  to the extent that it is deeply connected to, taken up in,
                  and/or transformed by teaching and leadership practice. © 2015

                  increasingly developing an outward orientation, seeking to
                  connect to students' out-of-school participations.
                  Simultaneously, educational research is starting to adopt a
                  multisystemic approach to learning. Focusing on continuity and
                  discontinuity in students' learning across school and
                  out-of-school contexts, we synthesize 186 empirical studies.
                  After conceptualizing school and out-of-school in relation to
                  each other, we find that continuity can be the result of
                  different educational intentions, but it also occurs as a
                  given. Discontinuity is mainly found for non-mainstream
                  students, with severe implications for students' learning and
                  participation in school. Some studies show how different
                  actors, including students, deliberately seek discontinuity,
                  challenging the widespread preference for continuity. We
                  discuss the (im)possibilities for schools in connecting to
                  students' wider lives and advance the degrees of freedom
                  afforded in school as an underlying condition for establishing

  abstract     = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate concepts
                  that are used in depicting future visions of society, as
                  afforded by technology, to map the extent of their use,
                  examine the level of their dominance in different research
                  areas and geographic boundaries, identify potential overlaps,
                  analyse their longitudinal growth, and examine whether any of
                  the identified concepts has assumed an overarching position.
                  Design/methodology/approach - In total, 14 concepts, each of
                  which is used to depict visions of future information
                  infrastructures, were identified. More than 20,000 scholarly
                  documents related to 11 of these concepts (those with 20 or
                  more documents) are analysed by various
                  qualitative/quantitative methods. Findings - The concepts most
                  referred to aresemantic web andubiquitous computing (all
                  years), andinternet of things (Year 2013). Publications on
                  some newer concepts (e.g.digital living ,real world internet )
                  are minimal. There are variations in the extent of use and
                  preferred concepts based on geographic and disciplinary
                  boundaries. The overlap in the use of these terms is minimal
                  and none of these terms has assumed an overarching umbrella
                  position. Research limitations/implications - This study is
                  limited to scholarly publications; it would be relevant to
                  also study the pattern of usage in governmental communications
                  and policy documents. Social implications - By mapping
                  multiplicity of concepts and the dispersion of discussions,
                  the authors highlight the need for, and facilitate, a broader
                  discussion of related social and societal implications.
                  Originality/value - This paper is the first to present a
                  collective of these related concepts and map the pattern of
                  their occurrence and growth.},

                  determine if and how simulation, including games, simulated
                  patients, and roleplay, might develop empathy and empathetic
                  behaviors in learners. Eleven databases or clearing houses
                  including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and ERIC were
                  searched for all articles published from any date until May

                  professional students, (ii) simulation, and (iii) empathy.
                  Twentyseven studies met the inclusion criteria, including 9
                  randomized controlled trials. A narrative synthesis suggests

                  has been a controversial matter. In this paper the debate in
                  two Swedish newspapers on the use of mobile phones in schools
                  is analysed using a historical materialist framework. The
                  results are discussed in relation to contemporary research on
                  mobile learning. The analysis reveals that the debate has been
                  a consequence of a conflict of control of the process of
                  learning in schools. Statements from the stakeholders in the
                  debate indicate that it primarily has been a conflict between
                  those who rule school, the legislators, and those who are
                  ruled, the school staff and the pupils. Knowledge of this
                  could contribute to the understanding of difficulties
                  occurring when implementing a mobile learning concept in the
                  educational system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA,

                  important new pedagogical approach ideally suited to the

                  experience afforded by cMOOCs is suited to learners with
                  different skills, motivations, and dispositions. In this
                  study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29
                  participants on the Change11 cMOOC. These accounts were
                  analyzed to determine patterns of engagement and factors
                  affecting engagement in the course. Three distinct types of
                  engagement were recognized – active participation, passive
                  participation, and lurking. In addition, a number of key
                  factors that mediated engagement were identified including
                  confidence, prior experience, and motivation. This study adds
                  to the overall understanding of learning in cMOOCs and
                  provides additional empirical data to a nascent research
                  field. The findings provide an insight into how the learning
                  experience afforded by cMOOCs suits the diverse range of
                  learners that may coexist within a cMOOC. These insights can
                  be used by designers of future cMOOCs to tailor the learning
                  experience to suit the diverse range of learners that may
                  choose to learn in this way.}

                  and developed community in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)
                  about Rhizomatic Learning (Rhizo14). We compared learner
                  experiences in two social networking sites (SNSs), Facebook
                  and Twitter. Our combination of thematic analysis of
                  qualitative survey data with analysis of participant
                  observation, activity data, archives and visualisation of SNS
                  data enabled us to reach a deeper understanding of participant
                  perspectives and explore SNS use. Community was present in the
                  course title and understood differently by participants. In
                  the absence of explanation or discussion about community early
                  in the MOOC, a controversy between participants about course
                  expectations emerged that created oppositional discourse. Fall
                  off in activity in MOOCs is common and was evident in Rhizo14.
                  As the course progressed, fewer participants were active in
                  Facebook and some participants reported feelings of exclusion.
                  Despite this, activity in Facebook increased overall. The top
                  10 most active participants were responsible for 47\% of total
                  activity. In the Rhizo14 MOOC, both community and curriculum
                  were expected to emerge within the course. We suggest that
                  there are tensions and even contradictions between ‘Community
                  Is the Curriculum’ and Deleuze and Guattari’s principles of
                  the rhizome, mainly focussed on an absence of heterogeneity.
                  These tensions may be exacerbated by SNSs that use algorithmic
                  streams. We propose the use of networking approaches that
                  enable negotiation and exchange to encourage heterogeneity
                  rather than emergent definition of community. Keywords:

                  This paper addresses a number of gaps in the scholarly
                  understanding of MOOCs and presents a comprehensive picture of
                  the literature by examining the geographic distribution,
                  publication outlets, citations, data collection and analysis
                  methods, and research strands of empirical research focusing
                  on MOOCs during this time period. Results demonstrate that (a)
                  more than 80\% of this literature is published by individuals
                  whose home institutions are in North America and Europe, (b) a
                  select few papers are widely cited while nearly half of the
                  papers are cited zero times, and (c) researchers have favored
                  a quantitative if not positivist approach to the conduct of
                  MOOC research, preferring the collection of data via surveys
                  and automated methods. While some interpretive research was
                  conducted on MOOCs in this time period, it was often basic and
                  it was the minority of studies that were informed by methods
                  traditionally associated with qualitative research (e.g.,
                  interviews, observations, and focus groups). Analysis shows
                  that there is limited research reported on instructorrelated
                  topics, and that even though researchers have attempted to
                  identify and classify learners into various groupings, very
                  little research examines the experiences of learner
                  subpopulations.},

                  online courses (MOOCs) may play in higher education, empirical
                  research that explores the realities of interacting and
                  learning in MOOCs is in its infancy. MOOCs have evolved from
                  previous incarnations of online learning but are distinguished
                  in their global reach and semi-synchronicity. Thus, it is
                  important to understand the ways that learners from around the
                  world interact in these settings. In this paper, we ask three
                  questions: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of
                  students that participate in MOOC discussion forums? (2) What
                  are the discussion patterns that characterize their
                  interactions? And (3) How does participation in discussion
                  forums relate to students' ﬁnal scores? Analysis of nearly
                  87,000 individuals from one MOOC reveals three key trends.
                  First, forum participants tend to be young adults from the
                  Western world. Secondly, these participants assemble and
                  disperse as crowds, not communities, of learners. Finally,
                  those that engage explicitly in the discussion forums are
                  often higher-performing than those that do not, although the
                  vast majority of forum participants receive “failing” marks.
                  These ﬁndings have implications for the design and
                  implementation of future MOOCs, and how they are
                  conceptualised as part of higher education.},

                  involved when creating and participating in an MOOC that is
                  meant to be a community rather than a course. By analysing
                  interviews of the organisers as well as blog posts and surveys
                  answered by participants, the conclusions that can be drawn
                  point to the ambiguity of the boundary created between
                  participating in a community and in a course. The way one is
                  expected to participate in the MOOC differs from how one is
                  usually expected to participate in professional development
                  courses. The social aspects of a community become the focus
                  for the participants in the MOOC rather than the content that
                  it is addressing. The skeletal structure of the MOOC inhibits
                  the participation of those who are unaccustomed to the digital
                  environment where it takes place. Furthermore, the division of
                  labour between participants and organisers is affected by the
                  notion of course and therefore becomes ambiguous and creates
                  tensions for both organisers and participants.},

                  "sociocultural," as opposed to "cultural-historical,"
                  "sociohistorical," or some other term, it is argued that an
                  adequate account of the agenda for sociocultural research must
                  be grounded in the notion of "mediated action." Drawing on the
                  writings of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others it is argued that
                  mediated action must be understood as involving an irreducible
                  tension between the mediational means provided by the
                  sociocultural setting, on the one hand, and the unique,
                  contextualized use of these means in carrying out particular
                  concrete actions, on the other. In this view, any attempt to
                  reduce the basic unit of analysis of mediated action to the
                  mediational means or to the individual in isolation is
                  misguided. It is suggested that by using mediated action as a
                  unit of analysis the human sciences will be in a better
                  position to address some of today's most pressing social

                  virtual ethnographic study was designed to examine the
                  experiences of 12 adult learners with bachelors’ and masters’
                  degrees, enrolled in a four-week MOOC on the topic of human
                  trafficking. Through the lenses of self-directed learning and
                  self-determination theories, we were interested in
                  investigating learners’ motivations for enrolling in the MOOC,
                  their perceptions of success and completion, and barriers

                  2.0 tools in their classrooms. A two-phase, mixed method,
                  sequential explanatory design was used. The first phase
                  explored factors, based on the decomposed theory of planned
                  behavior, that predict preservice teachers' intentions to
                  integrate Web 2.0 tools in their future classrooms. The
                  second, follow-up phase, explored preservice teachers'
                  transfer of intentions into actions during student teaching
                  and the factors that influenced actual use of Web 2.0 tools in
                  their classrooms. Results of the study showed that perceived
                  usefulness, selfefficacy, and student expectations were the
                  strongest predictors of preservice teachers' intentions and
                  actual use of Web 2.0 tools in the classroom. Additional
                  findings revealed a significant positive relationship between
                  preservice teachers' intentions and subsequent behaviors. The
                  results of the second phase of the study showed that although
                  most preservice teachers were able to carry out their
                  intentions, due to facilitative factors, a few were unable to
                  use Web 2.0 tools due to limited access to technology
                  resources and unsupportive mentor teachers. These findings
                  provide evidence that when preservice teachers perceive the
                  value of Web 2.0 tools to facilitate student learning, have
                  support from their K-12 students and mentor teachers, and have
                  high self-efficacy as well as easy access to Web 2.0 tools,
                  they are able to translate their intentions into actions.},

                  The qualitative analysis identified two dimensions that
                  teachers referred to in their professional development
                  stories: the professional development motivation
                  (intrinsic/extrinsic) and types of aspirations
                  (lateral/vertical). Using these dimensions, four ‘professional
                  development patterns’ emerged. Participants’ professional
                  trajectories are described in terms of these patterns:

                  Teacher Professional Development (TWG3). The focus was to
                  explore how professional development of teachers may ensure
                  that teachers are better prepared to use information and
                  communication technology (ICT) to promote 21st century
                  learning. The article is organized into three main sections: a
                  review of key literature on professional development of
                  teachers (TPD), in general and with specific reference to ICT;
                  a summary of the key points emerging from TWG3's discussions;
                  and recommendations for action. On the basis of discussions
                  held within the TWG3, the authors concluded that effective TPD
                  requires changes at several levels of educational systems

                  particularly in terms of classroom technology practices, often
                  did not align with their espoused beliefs. Researchers
                  concluded this was due, at least in part, to a variety of
                  external barriers that prevented teachers from using
                  technology in ways that aligned more closely with their
                  beliefs. However, many of these barriers (access, support,
                  etc.) have since been eliminated in the majority of schools.
                  This multiple case-study research was designed to revisit the
                  question, "How do the pedagogical beliefs and classroom
                  technology practices of teachers, recognized for their
                  technology uses, align?" Twelve K-12 classroom teachers were
                  purposefully selected based on their award-winning technology
                  practices, supported by evidence from personal and/or
                  classroom websites. Follow-up interviews were conducted to
                  examine the correspondence between teachers' classroom
                  practices and their pedagogical beliefs. Results suggest close
                  alignment; that is student-centered beliefs undergirded
                  student-centered practices (authenticity, student choice,
                  collaboration). Moreover, teachers with student-centered
                  beliefs tended to enact student-centered curricula despite
                  technological, administrative, or assessment barriers.
                  Teachers' own beliefs and attitudes about the relevance of
                  technology to students' learning were perceived as having the
                  biggest impact on their success. Additionally, most teachers
                  indicated that internal factors (e.g.; passion for technology,
                  having a problem-solving mentality) and support from others
                  (administrators and personal learning networks) played key
                  roles in shaping their practices. Teachers noted that the
                  strongest barriers preventing other teachers from using
                  technology were their existing attitudes and beliefs toward
                  technology, as well as their current levels of knowledge and
                  skills. Recommendations are made for refocusing our
                  professional development efforts on strategies for
                  facilitating changes in teachers' attitudes and beliefs. ©

               regressors. The results shows that teachers are more incline to
               share their content when they expect other teachers to benefit
               greatly from it. Altruism also was found to be significantly

                  result of the expanding possibilities of ICT integration in
                  every aspect of the school milieu. Studies have shown the
                  potential of teacher professional development (TPD) that is
                  tailored to local conditions as well as global components and
                  takes advantage of mutual support among teachers, as well as
                  modeling of effective practices. The goal of the paper is to
                  consider the issue of TPD with reference to the usage of ICT
                  as a lever for educational change in a systemic manner, based
                  on the application of local as well as international research.
                  This paper will synthesize some key issues and challenges for
                  TPD in the ICT-saturated 21st century, illustrated in four
                  cases presented herein, which synthesize elements of practice
                  and theory. Based on the literature and the four case studies,
                  we suggest a conceptual model for identifying and evaluating
                  TPD practices using ICT as a lever for educational change and
                  innovation, accompanied by research aimed to develop TPD
                  models. We include suggestions for more effectively linking

                  which he proposed using technology as cognitive tools, we
                  suggest that future technology integration efforts should
                  focus on helping teachers engage students in authentic
                  technology-enabled learning environments. As such, technology
                  integration is no longer an isolated goal to be achieved
                  separately from pedagogical goals, but simply the means by
                  which students engage in relevant and meaningful

                  working toward shared professional goals in online communities
                  of practice. A core issue in designing and developing
                  community computing infrastructures – the underlying
                  socio-technical layer that supports communitarian activities –
                  is sustainability. Many community computing initiatives fail
                  because the underlying infrastructure does not meet end user
                  requirements; the community is unable to maintain a critical
                  mass of users consistently over time; it generates insuﬃcient
                  social capital to support signiﬁcant contributions by members

                  peers, online social spaces are increasingly highlighted as
                  playing a key role in teachers’ professional learning and
                  development. However, while academic and professional
                  discourses tend to focus on the benefits and weaknesses of
                  teachers’ engagement in online social spaces, little attention
                  has been given to the spaces themselves. Rooted in
                  essentialist or instrumentalist assumptions about technology,
                  these spaces are often conceptualised as neutral contexts,
                  free from values, structures, and agendas that simply
                  facilitate interaction. However, presenting data gathered
                  during a year-long digital ethnography of three such spaces,
                  this paper argues that they are in fact highly complex social
                  environments that contain embedded structures relating to
                  technical design and functionality, dominant discourses, and
                  the agendas of parent organisations. Such structures shape
                  user engagement and have a constructive influence over the
                  ways in which teachers think about their subjects and
                  themselves as professionals. Therefore, it is argued that in
                  order to understand fully the place online social spaces could
                  or should have in teachers’ professional lives, the complex
                  online environments in which teachers engage and the
                  relationship between structure and agency must be analysed.},

                  have been few efforts to study how teacher educators prepare
                  their students to responsibly use and teach about social
                  media. This study analyzes 71 students' survey data,
                  reflections, and class activities from education courses
                  across three universities to better understand the successes
                  and shortcomings of social media experiences. Shortcomings
                  included defects in course organization and facilitation,
                  mismatches between instructors and students' expectations or
                  preferred uses, and pre-service teachers' generally narrow
                  visions of how social media might be leveraged educationally

  abstract     = {Connectivism offers a theory of learning for the digital age
                  that is usually understood as contrasting with traditional
                  behaviourist, cognitivist, and constructivist approaches. This
                  article will provide an original and significant development
                  of this theory through arguing and demonstrating how it can
                  benefit from social constructivist perspectives and a focus on
                  dialogue. Similarly, I argue that we need to ask whether
                  networked social media is, essentially, a new landscape for
                  dialogue and therefore should be conceived and investigated
                  based on this premise, through considering dialogue as the
                  primary means to develop and exploit connections for learning.
                  A key lever in this argument is the increasingly important
                  requirement for greater criticality on the Internet in
                  relation to our assessment and development of connections with
                  people and resources. The open, participative, and social Web
                  actually requires a greater emphasis on higher order cognitive
                  and social competencies that are realised predominantly
                  through dialogue and discourse. Or, as Siemens (2005) implies
                  in his call to rethink the fundamental precepts of learning,
                  we need to shift our focus to promoting core evaluative skills
                  for flexible learning that will, for example, allow us to
                  actuate the knowledge we need at the point that we need it. A
                  corollary of this is the need to reorient educational
                  experiences to ensure that we develop in our learners the
                  ability “to think, reason, and analyse.” In considering how we
                  can achieve these aims this article will review the principles
                  of connectivism from a dialogue perspective; propose some
                  social constructivist approaches based on dialectic and
                  dialogic dimensions of dialogue, which can act as levers in
                  realising connectivist learning dialogue; demonstrate how
                  dialogue games can link the discussed theories to the design
                  and performance of networked dialogue processes; and consider
                  the broader implications of this work for designing and
                  delivering sociotechnical learning.}

                  development, its definitions and significance. The second
                  chapter presents information on the impact of teachers
                  professional development on education systems and students
                  learning, and reflects on the relation between teachers
                  professional development and effective school and
                  education-system reforms. The third chapter is devoted to
                  reflecting on the teaching profession: when and how it begins,
                  and how it develops throughout a persons professional career.
                  It discusses in some detail the process of pre-service
                  education, and describes the traditional form of in-service
                  education. This is followed by the fourth chapter which
                  describes models of professional development in detail, and
                  whenever possible illustrates each model with a description of
                  experiences and initiatives that have used that particular
                  model in a variety of countries and societies. The fifth

                  knowledge-sharing behaviour. It employs the interpretative
                  approach to examine how teachers conceptualise their
                  engagement with two USA-based online knowledge-sharing
                  platforms within the context of their broader teaching
                  practice. The findings suggest that the platforms, together
                  with teachers? engagement with them, are intimately connected
                  with, and must be understood in reference to, both the online
                  and offline contexts in which they operate, with each setting
                  providing unique affordances that shape engagement and
                  outcomes. Teachers? engagement was largely motivated by their
                  individual knowledge requirements and practice-based needs,
                  resulting in learning primarily being individually rather than
                  socially mediated and constructed.},

                  especially related with peer production. We analyzed the
                  topology of these networks in two ways: a) the indirect
                  relations by counting followers and followed people; and b)
                  the conversational networks by counting mentions in tweets. We

                  whether their production was lightweight or heavyweight peer
                  production. Results indicate that teacher networks adopt a
                  community clusters archetype in which some teachers act as
                  bridges between several groups. Although these networks do not
                  form a tight crowd, their degree of tightness is superior to

                  important for sustaining heavyweight peer production and
                  strong leadership can play a crucial role in establishing

                  actions in the Edmodo Math Subject Community, a popular PDN.
                  Cultural historical activity theory was used as a framework
                  for examining the socially constructed actions of seeking and
                  sharing knowledge in a PDN. The findings suggest that seeking
                  and sharing knowledge is a complex, dynamically evolving
                  process that is shaped by the technical (e.g., tools) and
                  social (e.g., community members, rules, roles) aspects of the
                  PDN. Implications and ideas for further research are
                  discussed.},

                  learning in Web 2.0 environments, which underpins the pedagogy
                  of what are known as cMOOCs (connectivist massive open online
                  courses). We argue that this conception of learning is
                  inadequate and problematic, and we propose that cultural

                  challenges that Web 2.0 poses on learn- ing, and therefore, it

                  understanding motivation to learn in massive open online
                  courses (MOOCs). Therefore, the goal of this study was
                  threefold: a. to compare motivation patterns of MOOC
                  participants who study the same course but in a different
                  language of instruction; b. to examine relationships between
                  motivation gain and diverse modes of engagement; and c. to
                  characterize MOOC completers according to their learning
                  motivation. An exploratory case-study was conducted in the
                  settings of a MOOC in Nanotechnology and Nanosensors,
                  delivered in two languages: English and Arabic. The research
                  sample included 325 participants from the English (N = 289)
                  and Arabic (N = 36) MOOCs. The study applied the mixed methods
                  approach, collecting data via pre- and post-questionnaires,
                  forum posts, and email messages. Findings indicated that
                  regardless the language of instruction, MOOC participants were
                  driven to learn by similar goals, emphasizing intrinsic
                  motivation and self-determination. Findings indicated a
                  positive relationship between motivation gain, the number of
                  messages posted to the online forums, and the number of
                  members in the online study groups. Five types of MOOC
                  completers were identified: problem-solvers, networkers,

                  confines of increasing specialization in the social sciences.
                  In response to this "conceptual blindness," he proposes a
                  method of socio-cultural analysis that connects the various
                  perspectives of the social sciences in an integrated,
                  nonreductive fashion. Wertsch maintains that we can use
                  mediated action, which he defines as the irreducible tension
                  between active agents and cultural tools, as a productive
                  method of explicating the complicated relationships between
                  human action and its manifold cultural, institutional, and
                  historical contexts. Drawing on the ideas of Lev Vygotsky,
                  Mikhail Bakhtin, and Kenneth Burke, as well as research from
                  various fields, this book traces the implications of mediated

                  associative, constructivist, reflective, situated,

                  consisting of computer science teachers teaching in primary
                  and secondary public schools (K-9), in Greece. The conceptual

  abstract = {The uptake and use of digital technologies continues to increase
              in schools throughout the world. In many schools the uptake and
              use of digital technologies takes place in One-to-One (1:1)
              initiatives in which teachers and students have their own laptops.
              In this thesis the uptake and use of digital technologies is
              studied from the student, teacher and school leader perspectives
              in order to through this gain knowledge regarding the conditions
              for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and educational change in
              K-12 schools. In the Unos Umeå research project the uptake and use
              of digital technologies in two schools, an upper secondary school
              and a compulsory school, was studied. A research design involving
              a case study approach (Yin, 2003, 2009) was used to study a 1:1
              initiative. The methods of data collection were surveys,
              interviews and classroom observations. To explore, identify and
              describe conditions for TEL and educational change the data
              collected were used to map the initial expectations regarding the
              uptake and use of digital technologies from the start of the
              initiative as well as to follow the development of teaching and
              learning activities related to the uptake and use of digital
              technologies in the 1:1 classroom over a period of two years. The
              Ecology of Resources Model (Luckin, 2010) was used as a
              theoretical framework including the use of the concept of filters.
              Regarding the conditions for TEL, the results show that the uptake
              and use of digital technologies provides possibilities for new
              forms of teaching and learning in the 1:1 classroom. Students
              reported increased motivation, engagement and variation in
              schoolwork. Teachers described new forms of teaching as well as
              possibilities for collaboration, sharing of materials and
              continued professional development. For school leaders
              possibilities were found in collaboration, administrative support
              and follow-up of students and teachers, creating a unified vision
              of the work with digital technologies, and collaboration and
              sharing within the schools as an ecology of resources. The
              challenges seen from the student, teacher and school leader
              perspectives were related to use, technical support and
              optionality. If the possibilities are to be achieved, there is a
              need for continued professional development for teachers and
              school leaders. Further, clear directives through policy will be
              of importance. In the short term, the practical implications of
              the uptake and use of digital technologies, specifically in 1:1
              initiatives, seem to be strongly connected to sustainability in
              schools. In the long term, if sustainable conditions for TEL and
              educational change in the 1:1 classroom can be created and upheld,
              the practical implications may for example be teachers’ improved
              skills to integrate a thought-through student use of laptops in
              their teaching practices and an increase in equality of digital
              competence between students, between schools and between
              classrooms in the same school.},

                  education provision. With these ongoing debates in mind, the
                  current paper presents an in-depth qualitative analysis of the
                  Facebook 'wall' activity of 909 undergraduate students in a UK
                  university. Analysis of these data shows how much of students'
                  education-related use of this social networking application
                  was based around either the post-hoc critiquing of learning
                  experiences and events, the exchange of logistical or factual
                  information about teaching and assessment requirements,
                  instances of supplication and moral support with regards to
                  assessment or learning, or the promotion of oneself as
                  academically incompetent and/or disengaged. With these themes
                  in mind, the paper concludes that rather than necessarily
                  enhancing or eroding students' 'front-stage' engagement with
                  their formal studies, Facebook use must be seen as being
                  situated within the 'identity politics' of being a student. In
                  particular, Facebook appears to provide a ready space where
                  the 'role conflict' that students often experience in their
                  relationships with university work, teaching staff, academic
                  conventions and expectations can be worked through in a
                  relatively closed 'backstage' area.},

                  to move lectures outside the classroom and uses learning
                  activities to move practice with concepts inside the

                  an inverted introductory statistics class with a traditional
                  introductory statistics class at the same university. This

               The estimated emissions gap in 2020 for a “likely” chance of
               being on track to stay below the 2 C target is 8 to 13 GtCO 2 o e
               (depending on how emission reduction pledges are implemented), as
               compared to 6 to 11 GtCO e in last years’ Bridging the Emissions
               Gap Report. The gap is larger because of higher than expected
               economic growth and the inclusion of “double counting” of
               emission offsets in the calculations. To stay within the 2°C
               limit global emissions will have to peak before 2020 . Scenarios
               that meet the 2 o C limit show a maximum emission level in 2030
               of 37 GtCO2e. Scenarios that meet the 2 o C limit have global
               emissions in 2050 roughly 40\% below 1990 emission levels and
               roughly 60\% below 2010 emission levels. The technical potential
               for reducing emissions by 2020 is estimated to be about 17 ± 3
               GtCO 2 e, at marginal costs below US 50-100/ t CO 2 e reduced.
               This is enough to close the gap between BaU emissions and
               emissions that meet the 2°C or 1.5°C target.},

                  development, teaching and learning, teacher change, and
                  organizational learning. In doing so, it illustrates that
                  process–product logic has dominated the literature on teacher
                  professional learning and that this has limited explanatory
                  ability. The review demonstrates the ways the elements of
                  three subsystems (the teacher, the school, and the learning
                  activity) interact and combine in different ways and with
                  varying intensities to influence teacher learning. The
                  limitations of studies focusing on specific elements or
                  subsystems are highlighted. The article concludes that to
                  understand teacher learning scholars must adopt methodological
                  practices that focus on explanatory causality and the
                  reciprocal influences of all three subsystems.},

                  26, 2012). A strong personal/professional learning network
                  (PLN) provides an advantage for learners and educators not
                  available to those who work alone. Using a mixed-methods,
                  cross-sectional survey research method, this study was
                  designed to be the first in a series of research projects to
                  investigate how educators are using the framework of a PLN to
                  support and enhance classrooms to meet the needs of the
                  learners. Specifically, this study addresses the definition of
                  a PLN, positions social media as one avenue in building a PLN,
                  and describes how educators are using a PLN in the educational
                  environment. A PLN is a self-selected network of professionals
                  from various occupational fields whose members hold common
                  interests with the intent of sharing ideas and resources,
                  collaborating, and providing support with the purpose of
                  enhancing personal and professional learning. Educators use a
                  variety of social media platforms as part of a PLN and a
                  larger Personal Learning Environment (PLE). The most common
                  theme was the use of the PLN to enhance individual educator
                  knowledge through asking questions and seeking new resources
                  for classroom use. Educators report the use of the PLN to seek
                  professional development that is relevant to their individual
                  classrooms and situations. Understanding how a PLN within a
                  larger PLE can enhance the classroom experience for both
                  teachers and students is important.},

                  Undergraduate students imagined that, on a fictitious day at a
                  racetrack, they did not gamble in the prior race, that they
                  gambled and won, or that they gambled and lost. Subjects rated

                  they would be with not gambling, with gambling and winning,

                  suggests that humans strive towards an equal intertemporal
                  distribution of wealth. However, behavioral life-cycle theory
                  (Shefrin \& Thaler, 1988) proposes that people use
                  self-control heuristics to postpone wealth until later in
                  life. According to this theory, people use a system of
                  cognitive budgeting known as mental accounting. In the present
                  study it was found that mental accounts were used differently
                  depending on if the income change was positive or negative.
                  This was shown both in a representative nationwide sample of
                  households and in a student sample. Respondents were more
                  willing to cut down on their propensity to consume when faced
                  with an income decrease than to raise it when the income
                  increased. Furthermore, contrary to the predictions of
                  behavioral life-cycle theory, it was found that the
                  respondents adjusted their propensity to consume the most when
                  the income increases or decreases took place immediately.
                  Hence, it is suggested that theories of intertemporal choice
                  (e.g., Loewenstein, 1988; Loewenstein \& Prelec, 1992) provide
                  a better account of the data than does the behavioral
                  lifecycle theory. © 1997 JAI Press, Inc. All rights of

                  significant burden for patients with asthma-chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS).
                  However, few studies have studied this population in the
                  People’s Republic of China, a region in the midst of rapid
                  epidemiological change with respect to respiratory disease.
                  The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ACOS and
                  its association with patient outcomes in urban China. Methods:
                  Data from the 2010, 2012, and 2013 China National Health and
                  Wellness Survey, an Internet-based survey of adults in urban
                  China, were used (N=59,935). Respondents were categorized into
                  one of four groups based on self-reported physician diagnoses:
                  ACOS, asthma only, COPD only, or control (ie, no asthma or
                  COPD). A propensity score matching procedure was conducted to
                  cull the control group into a subgroup (ie, matched controls)
                  who resembled patients with ACOS, asthma only, and COPD only.
                  These four groups (ACOS, asthma only, COPD only, matched
                  controls) were then compared with respect to health status
                  (Short Form-12 version 2/Short Form-36 version 2), work
                  productivity, and health care resource use using generalized
                  linear models. Results: Patients with ACOS (N=366) comprised
                  0.61\% of the adult population, 30.73\% of the asthma
                  population, and 18.60\% of the COPD population in the People’s
                  Republic of China. Patients with ACOS reported significantly
                  worse health status (eg, health utilities =0.63, 0.66, 0.63,
                  and 0.69 for ACOS, COPD only, asthma only, and matched
                  controls, respectively) and significantly greater work
                  impairment (eg, overall work impairment =43.65\%, 35.19\%,
                  48.55\%, and 29.80\%, respectively) and health care resource
                  use (eg, physician visits in the past 6 months =5.13, 3.84,
                  4.65, and 2.39, respectively) compared with matched controls
                  and patients with COPD only. Few significant differences were
                  observed between patients with ACOS and asthma only.
                  Conclusion: Patients with ACOS have a greater comorbidity
                  burden and significantly worse health outcomes compared with

                  irrational. With the aim of demonstrating that such escalation

                  two experiments were carried out employing undergraduates as
                  participants. Experiment 1 showed for fictitious personal and
                  business investment scenarios that both prior losses and gains
                  (sunk outcomes) affected choices to continue or discontinue
                  the investment. In Experiment 2 the effect of sunk outcomes
                  was reduced although not eliminated by a monetary bonus that
                  in one condition depended on the future outcomes of the second
                  gamble in two-stage gambles, in another condition on the

                  Research design and methods: Quantitative internet interviews
                  with 803 COPD patients from Europe and the USA, including 289
                  patients with severe COPD. Severe COPD was defined according
                  to regular use of COPD medication, third level of
                  breathlessness or above using the modified Medical Research
                  Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale (MRC dyspnoea score ≥3) and one
                  or more COPD exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.
                  Results: Morning was the worst time of day for COPD symptoms,
                  particularly in patients with severe COPD (reported by 46\% of
                  severe patients). In these patients, shortness of breath was
                  the most frequently reported symptom, correlating strongly
                  with problems experienced with morning activities. Morning
                  activities most affected by COPD were walking up and down
                  stairs, putting on shoes and socks, making the bed, dressing,
                  showering or bathing and drying. The majority of patients were
                  not taking their medication in time for it to exert its
                  optimal effect. Conclusions: Many patients consider the impact
                  of COPD on morning activities to be substantial. Physicians
                  should question patients about morning activities to assess
                  disease impact and to advise regarding the optimal time to use
                  therapy. This was an internet-based questionnaire survey and
                  possible bias in patient selection and self-reported diagnosis
                  of COPD and its severity should be taken into account. © 2009

                  unsuccessful prior investments of money, effort, or time (sunk
                  costs). In previous research it is argued that escalation does
                  not occur when future outcomes and alternative investments are
                  transparent. Inconsistent with this argument, in an experiment
                  in which undergraduates were presented fictitious investment
                  problems with sunk costs, escalation was demonstrated when
                  full information was given about investment alternatives and
                  estimates of future returns. Thus, it is indicated that people
                  may escalate despite knowing that it will not make them
                  economically better off. A more comprehensive understanding of
                  escalation requires disentangling people's noneconomic reasons

                  predictions from the behavioral life-cycle theory (Shefrin \&
                  Thaler, 1988), the renewable resources model (Linville \&
                  Fischer, 1991) and the loss-sensitivity principle (Gärling \&
                  Romanus, 1997) were contrasted. The results are inconsistent
                  with the latter two explanations since the framing of buying
                  as positive (buying a new model of a product) or negative
                  (replacing a broken product) did not interact with the income

                  investments. Building on previous research demonstrating a
                  loss-sensitivity principle in sequential decision making, the
                  hypothesis was proposed that a loss-minimization goal would
                  lead to stronger effects of sunk outcomes (prior gains and
                  losses) than would a gain-maximizing goal. The hypothesis was
                  investigated in three experiments with undergraduates
                  responding to investment decision scenarios. Although the
                  tendency to continue investments was always larger for
                  gain-maximizing than for loss-minimizing goal instructions,
                  the sunk-outcome effect was stronger in the former case.
                  However, when the decisions were personal and concerned lower
                  stakes rather than business investments involving large
                  amounts of money, the expected stronger effect of sunk
                  outcomes was found for loss-minimizing goal instructions.
                  Another finding was that the expected value was never ignored,
                  thus suggesting that future research should focus on the joint
                  effects of the expected value and sunk outcomes. © 2002

  abstract     = {G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + channels (GIRKs; also
                  called Kir3) are a family of K + channels, which are activated
                  (opened) via a signal transduction cascade starting with
                  ligand-stimulated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Four
                  GIRK genes have been identified (GIRK1-4). GIRK4 (Kir3.4) has
                  a role in regulating energy homeostasis, since mice with a
                  targeted mutation in the GIRK4 gene exhibit a predisposition
                  to late-onset obesity. GIRK4 mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic
                  regions that harbor neurons involved in the regulation of food
                  intake and body weight. Using goat and rabbit antisera to the
                  GIRK4 protein, the cellular localization and transmitter
                  content of GIRK4-immunoreactive neurons was determined in the
                  hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, a region that contains neurons
                  which are accessible to circulating hormones and is intimately
                  associated with the control of body weight.
                  GIRK4-immunoreactive large cell bodies were demonstrated in
                  the ventrolateral part of the arcuate nucleus, with smaller
                  neuronal cell bodies in the ventromedial part of the nucleus.
                  Double-labeling showed presence of GIRK4 immunoreactivity in
                  large neurons of the ventrolateral arcuate nucleus containing
                  the peptides α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a
                  marker for pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, and cocaine-
                  and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). GIRK4
                  immunoreactivity was also seen in neurons of the ventromedial
                  part of the arcuate nucleus containing agouti-regulated
                  peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The results suggest
                  that the GIRK4 channel protein plays a role in regulating
                  membrane excitability in chemically defined neurons of the
                  arcuate nucleus that control body weight. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

                  multidimensional classification of COPD severity combines the
                  exacerbation risk with the symptom experience, for which 3
                  different questionnaires are permitted. This study
                  investigated differences in physical activity (PA) in the
                  different GOLD quadrants and patient's distribution in
                  relation to the questionnaire used. Methods: 136 COPD patients
                  (58±21\% FEV 1 predicted, 34F/102M) completed COPD assessment
                  test (CAT), clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) and modified
                  Medical Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire. Exacerbation
                  history, spirometry and 6MWD were collected. PA was
                  objectively measured for 2 periods of 1 week, 6 months apart,
                  in 5 European centres; to minimise seasonal and clinical
                  variation the average of these two periods was used for
                  analysis. Results: GOLD quadrants C+D had reduced PA compared
                  with A+B (3824 [2976] vs. 5508 [4671] steps.d-1, p < 0.0001).
                  The choice of questionnaire yielded different patient
                  distributions (agreement mMRC-CAT k = 0.57; CCQ-mMRC K = 0.71;
                  CCQ-CAT K = 0.72) with different clinical characteristics. PA
                  was notably lower in patients with an mMRC score ≥2 (3430
                  [2537] vs. 5443 [3776] steps.d -1 p < 0.001) in both the low
                  and high risk quadrants. Conclusions: Using different
                  questionnaires changes the patient distribution and results in
                  different clinical characteristics. Therefore, standardization
                  of the questionnaire used for classification is critical to
                  allow comparison of different studies using this as an entry

                  Surveys (NHWS) conducted between 2010 and 2013 (N = 59,935),
                  Internet-based surveys of adults in urban China. Patients were
                  categorized by asthma severity according to self-report and
                  Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA2014) guidelines via
                  self-reported medication use (mild [GINA 1-2] vs
                  moderate/severe [GINA 3-4] ). Propensity scores were used to
                  identify matched controls without asthma. These three groups
                  (mild vs. moderate/severe vs. matched control) were compared
                  with respect to QOL (revised Short Form-12/36), work
                  productivity (WPAI questionnaire), and healthcare use using
                  generalized linear models. Results: 1,191 respondents reported
                  an asthma diagnosis (1.99\%). Then 455 (0.77\% and 76.86\% of
                  the total sample and asthma sample which could be categorized
                  based on GINA2014 guidelines, respectively) and 897 (1.50\%
                  and 75.31\% of the total and asthma sample, respectively) had
                  mild asthma based on GINA2014 guidelines and self-report,
                  respectively. Compared with matched controls, mild patients
                  based on GINA2014 guidelines reported worse QOL (Physical
                  Component Summary = 44.67 vs. 48.97), more overall work
                  impairment (54.51\% vs. 34.35\%), and more all-cause emergency
                  room visits in the past 6 months (1.95 vs. 0.63 visits) (all p
                  < .05). Similar results were observed using self-reported
                  severity. Conclusions: Most patients with asthma in the China
                  NHWS are mild according to either definition. Asthma patients
                  experience significant burden to QOL, work productivity,
                  activity impairment, and healthcare resource use.},

                  number of adverse long-term side effects in the brain,
                  including cognitive impairment. Hippocampal neurogenesis is
                  important for place learning and has been shown to be
                  decreased by irradiation (IR) in rats and mice. In the present
                  study, 10-day-old male mice received 6-Gy IR to the brain on
                  postnatal day 10. We used BrdU labeling of the granule cell
                  layer (GCL) of the hippocampus to evaluate cell proliferation

                  used to evaluate place learning 2 months after IR. We show
                  that cranial IR impaired place learning and reduced BrdU
                  labeling by 50\% in the GCL. Cranial IR also reduced whole

  abstract     = {© 2016 The Author(s). Background: The morning tends to be the
                  most difficult time of day for many patients with chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when symptoms can limit
                  one's ability to perform even simple activities. Morning
                  symptoms have been linked to higher levels of work
                  absenteeism, thereby increasing the already substantial
                  economic burden associated with COPD. A validated
                  patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument designed to capture
                  morning symptoms will allow for a more comprehensive approach
                  to the evaluation of treatment benefit in COPD clinical
                  trials. Methods: A qualitative interview study was conducted
                  among a sample of symptomatic adults with COPD. Concept
                  elicitation interviews (n = 35) were conducted to identify
                  COPD morning symptoms, followed by cognitive interviews (n =
                  21) to ensure patient comprehension of the items, instructions
                  and response options of the draft COPD Morning Symptom Diary
                  (COPD-MSD). All interview transcript data were coded using
                  ATLAS.ti software for content analysis. Results: Mean age of
                  the concept elicitation and cognitive interview sample was
                  65.0 years (±7.5) and 62.3 years (±8.3), respectively. The
                  study sample represented the full range of COPD severity
                  (Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease [GOLD]
                  classifications I-IV) and included a mix of racial
                  backgrounds, employment status and educational achievement.
                  During the concept elicitation interviews, the three most
                  frequently reported morning symptoms were shortness of breath
                  (n = 35/35; 100 \%), phlegm/mucus (n = 31/35; 88.6 \%), and
                  cough (n = 30/35; 85.7 \%). A group of clinical and instrument
                  development experts convened to review the concept elicitation
                  data and develop the initial 32-item draft COPD-MSD. Cognitive
                  interviews indicated subjects found the draft COPD-MSD to be
                  comprehensive, clear, and easy to understand. The COPD-MSD
                  underwent minor editorial revisions and streamlining based on
                  cognitive interviews and input from the experts to yield the
                  final 19-item daily diary. Conclusions: This study supports
                  the content validity of the new COPD-MSD and positions the
                  diary for quantitative psychometric testing.},

                  of Daily Living during the Morning (CDLM) questionnaire and
                  the Global Chest Symptoms Questionnaire (GCSQ) were developed,
                  linguistically validated and incorporated into two
                  multicentre, randomised trials involving a total of 1,100 COPD
                  patients; those trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
                  (NCT00496470 and NCT00542880). Data from these trials were
                  used to determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness
                  of the questionnaires and to derive estimates of minimal
                  important differences (MIDs). Both questionnaires displayed
                  good-to-high reliability (Cronbach's α 0.75-0.93). Analysis of
                  convergent validity showed that CDLM and GCSQ scores
                  correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with symptoms,
                  health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and use of rescue
                  medication. In both trials, CDLM and GCSQ scores discriminated
                  between patients with different levels of HRQoL, as assessed
                  by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients
                  (SGRQ-C), but not with disease severity, as assessed by the
                  Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
                  criteria. A significant improvement in CDLM and GCSQ scores
                  occurred in response to treatment. Estimations of MID scores,
                  corresponding to an SGRQ-C MID of 4, were 0.20 for the CDLM
                  questionnaire and 0.15 for the GCSQ. Both the CDLM
                  questionnaire and the GCSQ are easy-to-use, reliable,
                  responsive, self-administered questionnaires that report on
                  patients' symptoms and ability to perform morning activities.

  abstract     = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used
                  multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and
                  Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix
                  rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation.
                  Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for
                  rotated solutions, although these have still not made their
                  way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps
                  because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by
                  the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis
                  (CFA) by Jöreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero
                  cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data
                  well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model
                  modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases,
                  searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better
                  carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore,
                  misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted
                  factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent
                  distorted structural relations. This article describes an
                  EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a
                  CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations
                  can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach
                  has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives
                  access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading
                  rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as
                  well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are
                  obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples
                  of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and
                  structural invariance testing, testretest (longitudinal) EFA,
                  EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with
                  correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA
                  and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used
                  to illustrate the points.},

                  diagnosis (P=0.06), GVHD prophylaxis with combinations other
                  than CsA+MTX (P=0.006), graft nucleated (P < 0.001) and CD34
                  (P < 0.001) cell-dose, bidirectional ABO mismatch (P=0.001),

                  high CD34 cell dose (P < 0.001), low dose (4mg/kg) ATG (P <
                  0.001), and an immunized female donor to male recipient (P <

                  had a higher incidence of GVHD, 53.7\%, compared to 22.3\% in
                  patients receiving a lower dose (P=0.002). In patients without
                  any of these risk factors (n=70), the incidence of acute GVHD

                  depression in the physical activity (PA) of patients with COPD
                  is controversial. We prospectively assessed the effect of
                  symptoms of anxiety and depression on PA in COPD patients.
                  Methods: We evaluated anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety
                  and Depression Scale [HADS]), PA (Dynaport® accelerometer),
                  and other relevant characteristics in 220 COPD patients from
                  five European countries at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of
                  follow-up. HADS score was categorized as: no symptoms (score
                  0–7), suggested (8–10), and probable ( > 11) anxiety or
                  depression. We estimated the association between anxiety and
                  depression at t (baseline and 6 months) and PA at t+1 (6 and
                  12 months) using regression models with a repeated measures
                  approach. Results: Patients had a mean (standard deviation)
                  age of 67 (8) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 57
                  (20)\% predicted. At baseline, the prevalence of probable
                  anxiety and depression was 10\% and 5\%, respectively. In
                  multivariable models adjusted by confounders and previous PA,
                  patients performed 81 fewer steps/day (95\% confidence
                  interval, –149 to –12, P=0.02) per extra point in
                  HADS-depression score. HADS-anxiety symptoms were not
                  associated with PA. Conclusion: In COPD patients, symptoms of
                  depression are prospectively associated with a measurable
                  reduction in PA 6 months later.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of physical activity in healthy populations and
                  in those with chronic diseases is challenging. The aim of this
                  systematic review was to identify whether available activity
                  monitors (AM) have been appropriately validated for use in
                  assessing physical activity in these groups. Following a
                  systematic literature search we found 134 papers meeting the
                  inclusion criteria; 40 conducted in a field setting
                  (validation against doubly labelled water), 86 in a laboratory
                  setting (validation against a metabolic cart, metabolic
                  chamber) and 8 in a field and laboratory setting. Correlation
                  coefficients between AM outcomes and energy expenditure (EE)
                  by the criterion method (doubly labelled water and metabolic
                  cart/chamber) and percentage mean differences between EE
                  estimation from the monitor and EE measurement by the
                  criterion method were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses
                  were performed to pool the results across studies where
                  possible. Types of devices were compared using meta-regression
                  analyses. Most validation studies had been performed in
                  healthy adults (n = 118), with few carried out in patients
                  with chronic diseases (n = 16). For total EE, correlation
                  coefficients were statistically significantly lower in
                  uniaxial compared to multisensor devices. For active EE,
                  correlations were slightly but not significantly lower in
                  uniaxial compared to triaxial and multisensor devices.
                  Uniaxial devices tended to underestimate TEE (-12.07 (95\%CI;
                  -18.28 to -5.85) \%) compared to triaxial (-6.85 (95\%CI;
                  -18.20 to 4.49) \%, p = 0.37) and were statistically
                  significantly less accurate than multisensor devices (-3.64
                  (95\%CI; -8.97 to 1.70) \%, p < 0.001). TEE was underestimated
                  during slow walking speeds in 69\% of the lab validation
                  studies compared to 37\%, 30\% and 37\% of the studies during
                  intermediate, fast walking speed and running, respectively.
                  The high level of heterogeneity in the validation studies is
                  only partly explained by the type of activity monitor and the
                  activity monitor outcome. Triaxial and multisensor devices
                  tend to be more valid monitors. Since activity monitors are
                  less accurate at slow walking speeds and information about
                  validated activity monitors in chronic disease populations is
                  lacking, proper validation studies in these populations are
                  needed prior to their inclusion in clinical trials. © 2012 Van

  abstract     = {A great deal of recent methodological research has focused on
                  two modern missing data analysis methods: maximum likelihood
                  and multiple imputation. These approaches are advantageous to
                  traditional techniques (e.g. deletion and mean imputation
                  techniques) because they require less stringent assumptions
                  and mitigate the pitfalls of traditional techniques. This
                  article explains the theoretical underpinnings of missing data
                  analyses, gives an overview of traditional missing data
                  techniques, and provides accessible descriptions of maximum
                  likelihood and multiple imputation. In particular, this
                  article focuses on maximum likelihood estimation and presents
                  two analysis examples from the Longitudinal Study of American
                  Youth data. One of these examples includes a description of
                  the use of auxiliary variables. Finally, the paper illustrates
                  ways that researchers can use intentional, or planned, missing

                  severity, health status and prognosis in patients with COPD
                  has not been systematically assessed. Our aim was to identify
                  and summarise studies assessing associations between physical
                  activity and its determinants and/or outcomes in patients with
                  COPD and to develop a conceptual model for physical activity
                  in COPD. Methods We conducted a systematic search of four
                  databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Psychinfo) prior to
                  November 2012. Teams of two reviewers independently selected
                  articles, extracted data and used the Grading of
                  Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
                  (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence. Results 86 studies were
                  included: 59 were focused on determinants, 23 on outcomes and
                  4 on both. Hyperinflation, exercise capacity, dyspnoea,
                  previous exacerbations, gas exchange, systemic inflammation,
                  quality of life and self-efficacy were consistently related to
                  physical activity, but often based on cross-sectional studies
                  and low-quality evidence. Results from studies of
                  pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments were
                  inconsistent and the quality of evidence was low to very low.
                  As outcomes, COPD exacerbations and mortality were
                  consistently associated with low levels of physical activity
                  based on moderate quality evidence. Physical activity was
                  associated with other outcomes such as dyspnoea,
                  health-related quality of life, exercise capacity and FEV1 but
                  based on cross-sectional studies and low to very low quality
                  evidence. Conclusions Physical act ivity level in COPD is
                  consistently associated with mortality and exacerbations, but
                  there is poor evidence about determinants of physical

                  important therapeutic target in chronic obstructive pulmonary
                  disease (COPD), what "physical activity" means to COPD
                  patients and how their perspective is best measured is poorly
                  understood. We designed a conceptual framework, guiding the
                  development and content validation of two patient reported
                  outcome (PRO) instruments on physical activity (PROactive PRO
                  instruments). 116 patients from four European countries with
                  diverse demographics and COPD phenotypes participated in three
                  consecutive qualitative studies (63\% male, age mean±SD 66±9
                  years, 35\% Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
                  Disease stage III-IV). 23 interviews and eight focus groups
                  (n554) identified the main themes and candidate items of the
                  framework. 39 cognitive debriefings allowed the clarity of the
                  items and instructions to be optimised. Three themes emerged,
                  i.e. impact of COPD on amount of physical activity, symptoms
                  experienced during physical activity, and adaptations made to
                  facilitate physical activity. The themes were similar
                  irrespective of country, demographic or disease
                  characteristics. Iterative rounds of appraisal and refinement
                  of candidate items resulted in 30 items with a daily recall
                  period and 34 items with a 7-day recall period. For the first
                  time, our approach provides comprehensive insight on physical
                  activity from the COPD patients' perspective. The PROactive
                  PRO instruments' content validity represents the pivotal basis

                  captures all dimensions of physical activity in chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our objective was item
                  reduction and initial validation of two instruments to measure
                  physical activity in COPD. Physical activity was assessed in a
                  6-week, randomised, two-way cross-over, multicentre study
                  using PROactive draft questionnaires (daily and clinical visit
                  versions) and two activity monitors. Item reduction followed
                  an iterative process including classical and Rasch model
                  analyses, and input from patients and clinical experts. 236
                  COPD patients from five European centres were included.
                  Results indicated the concept of physical activity in COPD had
                  two domains, labelled "amount" and "difficulty". After item
                  reduction, the daily PROactive instrument comprised nine items
                  and the clinical visit contained 14. Both demonstrated good
                  model fit (person separation index > 0.7). Confirmatory factor
                  analysis supported the bidimensional structure. Both
                  instruments had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α >
                  0.8), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation
                  coefficient ≥0.9) and exhibited moderate-to-high correlations
                  (r > 0.6) with related constructs and very low correlations (r
                  < 0.3) with unrelated constructs, providing evidence for
                  construct validity. Daily and clinical visit "PROactive
                  physical activity in COPD" instruments are hybrid tools
                  combining a short patient-reported outcome questionnaire and
                  two activity monitor variables which provide simple, valid and

                  extend Ford, MacCallum, and Tait’s (1986) review. Ford et al.
                  surveyed the same journals from 1975 to 1984, concluding that
                  researchers often applied EFA poorly (e.g., relying too
                  heavily on principal components analysis [PCA], eigenvalues
                  greater than 1 to choose the number of factors, and orthogonal
                  rotations). Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, and Strahan (1999)
                  reached a similar conclusion based on a much smaller sample of
                  studies. This review of 371 studies shows reason for greater
                  optimism. The tendency to use multiple number-of-factors
                  criteria and oblique rotations has increased somewhat. Most
                  important, the authors find that researchers tend to make
                  better decisions when EFA plays a more consequential role in
                  the research. They stress the importance of careful and
                  thoughtful analysis, including decisions about whether and how
                  EFA should be used.},

  abstract     = {© 2020 SEPAR Introduction: Although mean physical activity in
                  COPD patients declines by 400–500 steps/day annually, it is
                  unknown whether the natural progression is the same for all
                  patients. We aimed to identify distinct physical activity
                  progression patterns using a hypothesis-free approach and to
                  assess their determinants. Methods: We pooled data from two
                  cohorts (usual care arm of Urban Training [NCT01897298] and
                  PROactive initial validation [NCT01388218] studies) measuring
                  physical activity at baseline and 12 months (Dynaport
                  MoveMonitor). We identified clusters (patterns) of physical
                  activity progression (based on levels and changes of
                  steps/day) using k-means, and compared baseline
                  sociodemographic, interpersonal, environmental, clinical and
                  psychological characteristics across patterns. Results: In 291
                  COPD patients (mean ± SD 68 ± 8 years, 81\% male, FEV1 59 ±
                  19\%pred) we identified three distinct physical activity
                  progression patterns: Inactive (n = 173 [59\%], baseline: 4621
                  ± 1757 steps/day, 12-month change (Δ): −487 ± 1201 steps/day),
                  Active Improvers (n = 49 [17\%], baseline: 7727 ± 3275
                  steps/day, Δ: + 3378 ± 2203 steps/day) and Active Decliners (n
                  = 69 [24\%], baseline: 11 267 ± 3009 steps/day, Δ: −2217 ±
                  2085 steps/day). After adjustment in a mixed multinomial
                  logistic regression model using Active Decliners as reference
                  pattern, a lower 6-min walking distance (RRR [95\% CI] 0.94
                  [0.90–0.98] per 10 m, P =.001) and a higher mMRC dyspnea score
                  (1.71 [1.12–2.60] per 1 point, P =.012) were independently
                  related with being Inactive. No baseline variable was
                  independently associated with being an Active Improver.
                  Conclusions: The natural progression in physical activity over
                  time in COPD patients is heterogeneous. While Inactive
                  patients relate to worse scores for clinical COPD
                  characteristics, Active Improvers and Decliners cannot be
                  predicted at baseline.},

              study of teachers' educational design with {ICT}},
  author   = {Holmberg, Jörgen},
  isbn     = {9789177975359},
  abstract = {In an increasingly digitized world teachers are expected to take
              on the role of educational designers and use ICT to design in ways
              that add pedagogical value to teaching and learning. This thesis
              adopts a design-based research (DBR) approach to: (a) explore and
              contribute to the educational design processes of teachers of
              English as a foreign language in their efforts to use ICT for
              added pedagogical value, (b) examine how ICT is used in
              educational designs to create/contribute to what the teachers and
              students describe as added value and (c) explore, problematize and
              refine DBR as a research approach. Literature studies and a
              collaborative self-study preceded the DBR to guide its focus and
              implementation. The DBR was carried out over a period of two years
              in four upper secondary schools in Sweden in which every student
              had access to their own computer. The research data consists of:
              (a) audio recorded design conversations, (b) enacted educational
              designs and design elements as parts of these, (c) reflective log
              entries written by the participating teachers, (d) focus group
              interviews with students and (e) the researcher's field notes. Six
              different theoretical frameworks and models are used in
              combination in the accompanying articles to analyze the data and
              achieve the three research aims. The findings show how teachers'
              pedagogical reasoning and TPACK development are interconnected and
              reciprocal aspects of the educational design process and how the
              externalization of, and reflection on, these aspects is necessary
              to develop the specific and practical TPACK needed to realize
              design intentions in situated contexts. A number of challenges and
              opportunities in the educational process have been identified.
              Moreover, the findings show how ICT was used to contribute added
              value in educational designs by facilitating: (a) more authentic
              and seamless learning experiences in external online contexts with
              both in-class and out-of-class actors irrespective of time and
              place, (b) an exchange of digital knowledge representations of
              understanding and practice between different actors, e.g. for the
              purposes of modelling, supporting cognitive apprenticeship,
              meta-cognitive self-regulation and formative assessment and (c)
              new and extended forms of, and opportunities for, collaborative
              creation and meaning-making. The current common focus in DBR on
              the development of prescriptive design principles is problematized
              in relation to the findings of the thesis, which illustrate the
              complex and situated nature of the educational design process. A
              theoretically and empirically informed design framework (DF) is
              developed and used as a conceptual tool to guide and analyze
              educational design processes and enactments. The findings
              illustrate how the use of the DF and the process of collaborative
              design reflection contributed to the analysis of the teachers'
              design intentions and de facto design practices and to a DBR
              format that allowed the participants to use their respective
              competencies in the development of educational designs for added
              value. The thesis thereby serves as an example of how DBR can be
              methodically implemented to study and generate increased knowledge
              about teachers' design intentions and design practices, develop
              research-based educational designs in line with teachers'
              pedagogical intentions and support their development as
              educational designers.},

  abstract     = {© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Background: Frequency of moderate and
                  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations is
                  an important endpoint in clinical trials, but makes them large
                  and lengthy when powered to evaluate it. We aimed to develop a
                  composite endpoint (COPDCompEx) that could predict treatment
                  effect on exacerbations, enabling the design of shorter early
                  phase clinical trials requiring fewer patients. Methods: In
                  this post hoc analysis, data from 20 randomized controlled
                  trials were used to develop and test COPDCompEx. Diary events
                  were tested against predefined threshold values for peak
                  expiratory flow, reliever medication use, and symptoms. A
                  COPDCompEx event was defined as first occurrence of a diary
                  event, a moderate or severe exacerbation, or a study dropout.
                  Ratios of event frequency, treatment effect and future trial
                  sample size were compared between COPDCompEx and moderate and
                  severe exacerbations. Findings: At 3 months, the proportion of
                  patients experiencing COPDCompEx events increased over 3-fold
                  versus exacerbations alone. All components contributed to
                  COPDCompEx event rate. Treatment effects at 3 months were
                  closely matched between COPDCompEx and exacerbations, and the
                  large net gain in power substantially reduced the required
                  sample size. Interpretation: COPDCompEx may be used to predict
                  treatment effect on moderate and severe exacerbations of
                  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This may enable the
                  design of shorter Phase 2 clinical trials requiring fewer
                  patients when compared with current exacerbation studies, with
                  exacerbations as a key Phase 3 endpoint. This would,
                  therefore, allow more efficient decision-making with reduced
                  burden and risk to study participants.},

  abstract     = {The use of head mounted displays (HMDs) to experience virtual
                  realities (VR) has become increasingly common. As this
                  technology becomes more affordable, immersive and easier to
                  use, it also becomes more serviceable in educational and
                  training contexts. Even though the technology, content and
                  feasibility for K-12 school purposes are still being
                  developed, it is reasonable to expect that the call or ‘push’
                  to use HMD VR in K-12 schools will increase, especially as
                  there is now a greater economic interest in the use of digital
                  technologies in educational contexts. This article aims to
                  inform the process of implementing HMD VR in K-12 contexts by
                  researching the preconditions and challenges of use from a
                  teacher perspective. It does this by analysing the
                  organisational, institutional, contextual and practical
                  challenges and opportunities in the implementation of HMD VR
                  in K-12 school contexts. The data draws on (a) interviews,
                  informal conversations and observations of teachers testing
                  HMD VR and different VR applications in a Digital Learning Lab
                  (DLL) and (b) data from a project involving upper secondary
                  school history teachers discussing the planned implementation
                  of HMD VR in their teaching and being in the DLL. The main
                  findings are related to: (a) economy and technology, (b)

                  technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and educational
                  robots (ER), are in focus. The aim of the paper is to explore
                  how teachers, researchers and pedagogical developers
                  critically imagine and reflect upon how AI and robots could be
                  used in education. The empirical data were collected from
                  discussion groups that were part of a symposium. For both AI
                  and ERs, the need for more knowledge about these technologies,
                  how they could preferably be used, and how the emergence of
                  these technologies might affect the role of the teacher and
                  the relationship between teachers and students, were outlined.
                  Many participants saw more potential to use AI for
                  individualization as compared with ERs. However, there were
                  also more concerns, such as ethical issues and economic
                  interests, when discussing AI. While the
                  researchers/developers to a greater extent imagined ideal
                  future technology-rich educational practices, the
                  practitioners were more focused on imaginaries grounded in
                  current practice.},

                  analytics show that the great majority of learners are highly
                  qualified professionals, and not, as originally envisaged, the
                  global community of disadvantaged learners who have no access
                  to good higher education. MOOC pedagogy fits well with the
                  combination of instruction and peer community learning found
                  in most professional development. A UNESCO study therefore set
                  out to test the efficacy of an experimental course for
                  teachers who need but do not receive high-quality continuing
                  professional development, as a way of exploiting what MOOCs
                  can do indirectly to serve disadvantaged students. The course
                  was based on case studies around the world of information and
                  communication technology (ICT) in primary education and was
                  carried out to contribute to the UNESCO ''Education For All''
                  goal. It used a co-learning approach to engage the primary
                  teaching community in exploring ways of using ICT in primary
                  education. Course analytics, forums and participant surveys
                  demonstrated that it worked well. The paper concludes by
                  arguing that this technology has the power to tackle the
                  large-scale educational problem of developing the
                  primary-level teachers needed to meet the goal of universal

                  three-year period. The goals for the project were based on the
                  general goals of the Finnish national framework curriculum and
                  ICT strategy. Self-evaluation data showed that partic- ipating

                  groups and in optimal locations); and (iii) context

  abstract  = {In recent years, knowledge building as a pedagogical approach has
               gained in popularity, and some sizeable networks of teachers
               using the Knowledge Forum platform to support the learning and
               teaching process have emerged. This provides a unique opportunity
               for empirical explorations that span across different classrooms
               to identify trends and regularities in the knowledge building
               developmental trajectory of a community of learners (including
               the teacher who is designing and facilitating the educational
               process) in classroom contexts. On the other hand, it poses a
               serious challenge to teachers and researchers on how to analyze
               and make sense of the large corpora of discourses generated by
               students. This study is an attempt to develop a methodology that
               can take advantage of the increasing collection of online corpora
               in Knowledge Forum for the incremental establishment of profiles
               and models of knowledge building behavior and interactions that
               reflect different levels of productivity in knowledge building.
               The focus of the present research is on the progress and
               development of the entire community, which aligns with the
               predominant focus on the construction and advancement of
               collective knowledge in knowledge building research. The goal of
               this study is to develop a methodology, including the
               identification of appropriate indicators and tools that can be
               used to provide a quick, first level assessment of the level of
               knowledge building reflected in a Knowledge Forum corpus using
               machine analysis and visualization, building on previous research
               in the area. Such a methodology will help to (1) build an
               empirically grounded understanding of learners trajectories of
               advancement in knowledge building; and (2) identify pedagogical
               and facilitation designs that are more conducive to deeper levels
               of knowledge building by students. We implemented automatic
               encoding and visualization on a number of Knowledge Forum corpora
               collected from primary and secondary classrooms in Hong Kong
               around the themes of energy crisis and global warming. The
               findings indicate that visualization of different indicators
               applied in sequence provides some useful insight on the quality
               and level of engagement in online asynchronous discussions. Basic
               participation statistics at discourse and thread levels are
               useful in discriminating truncated inquiries from other, more
               engaging ones. Linear visualization of the time sequence of
               discourse markers for argumentation, questions and scaffolds
               sheds light on whether there is evidence of cycles of progressive
               inquiry. Fine grained identification of subject matter content
               reveals whether the discussion is likely to be an extensive
               inquiry or an intensive one. The study also demonstrates a clear
               need for automated coding and visualization of discourse corpora
               to be augmented and validated by a review of the actual discourse
               data by human researchers to yield more in-depth understanding of
               the knowledge building processes.},

  abstract     = {Research on teachers' grading has shown that there is great
                  variability among teachers regarding both the process and
                  product of grading, resulting in low comparability and issues
                  of inequality when using grades for selection purposes.
                  Despite this situation, not much is known about the merits or
                  disadvantages of different models for grading. In this study,
                  a methodology for comparing two models of grading in terms of
                  (a) agreement between assessors (reliability) and (b)
                  justifications for the grades assigned (validity) was used
                  with a small sample of teachers (n = 24). The design is
                  experimental, with teachers being randomly assigned to two
                  conditions, where they graded the same student performance
                  using either an analytic or a holistic approach. Grades have
                  been compared in terms of agreement and rank correlation, and
                  justifications have been analyzed with content analysis.
                  Findings suggest that the analytic condition yields
                  substantively higher agreement among assessors as compared to
                  the holistic condition (66 versus 46 percent agreement;
                  Cohen's kappa .60 versus .41), as well as higher rank
                  correlation (Spearman's rho .97 versus .94), without any major
                  differences in how the grades were justified. On the contrary,
                  there was a relatively strong consensus among most raters in
                  the sample. In most educational contexts, grading means making
                  a holistic judgment about student overall performance
                  according to grading criteria. Even though the criteria and
                  the scale may differ, grading often involves taking a diverse
                  set of performances-such as written tests, lab-reports, oral
                  presentations, group discussions, etc.-into account when
                  making a decision about students' final grades. Teachers may
                  have very different strategies for this complex endeavor (e.g.
                  Korp, 2006; McMillan, Myran, \& Workman, 2002), which is
                  manifested in the great variation in the grades teachers
                  assign to students' work (Brookhart et al., 2016). This study
                  uses a combination of experimental design and content analysis
                  to compare two different models of grading student
                  performance: one analytic and one holistic. In the holistic
                  model, teachers make a decision about students' grades from a
                  holistic judgment of all available data on student proficiency
                  in the subject (i.e. similar to a portfolio). They also
                  refrain from making analytical judgments along the grading
                  scale for individual assignments during the semester. In the
                  analytic model, on the other hand, teachers continuously grade
                  students' assignment and use these "assignment-grades" when
                  deciding on an overall grade at the end of the semester. The
                  main differences are therefore that in the analytic model,
                  each decision is based on student performance on individual
                  assignments and that the teachers use these
                  "assignment-grades" to inform their decision on the final
                  grade, while in the holistic model the decision is based on a
                  more comprehensive set of data with no previous quantitative
                  assessments to inform the decision. The purpose is to
                  investigate whether there are differences between these models
                  in terms of agreement among teachers and how teachers use data
                  on student performance to inform their decisions.},

  abstract     = {This work uses microgenetic study of classroom learning to
                  illuminate (1) the role of preinstructional student knowledge
                  in the construction of normative scientiﬁc knowledge, and (2)
                  the learning mechanisms that drive change. Three enactments of
                  an instructional sequence designed to lead to a scientiﬁc
                  understanding of thermal equilibration are used as data
                  sources. Only data from a scaffolded student inquiry preceding
                  introduction of a normative model were used. Hence, the study
                  involves nearly autonomous student learning. In two classes,
                  students developed stable and socially shared explanations
                  (“causal schemes”) for understanding thermal equilibration.
                  One case resulted in a near-normative understanding, while the
                  other resulted in a non-normative “alternative conception.”
                  The near-normative case seems to be a particularly clear
                  example wherein the constructed causal scheme is a composition
                  of previously documented na€ıve conceptions. Detailed prior
                  description of these naive elements allows a much better than
                  usual view of the corresponding details of change during
                  construction of the new scheme. A list of candidate mechanisms
                  that can account for observed change is presented. The
                  non-normative construction seems also to be a composition,
                  albeit of a different structural form, using a different
                  (although similar) set of na¨ıve elements. This article
                  provides one of very few high-resolution process analyses
                  showing the productive use of na€ıve knowledge in learning.},

                  techniques, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has been extensively
                  applied in education. Artiﬁcial intelligence in education
                  (AIEd) opens new opportunities, potentials, and challenges in
                  educational practices. In its short history, AIEd has been
                  undergoing several paradigmatic shifts, which are
                  characterized into three paradigms in this position paper:
                  AI-directed, learner-as-recipient, AIsupported,
                  learner-as-collaborator, and AI-empowered, learner-as-leader.
                  In three paradigms, AI techniques are used to address
                  educational and learning issues in varied ways. AI is used to
                  represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while
                  learners are recipients of AI service in Paradigm One; AI is
                  used to support learning while learners work as collaborators
                  with AI in Paradigm Two; AI is used to empower learning while
                  learners take agency to learn in Paradigm Three. Overall, the
                  development trend of AIEd has been developing to empower
                  learner agency and personalization, enable learners to reﬂect
                  on learning and inform AI systems to adapt accordingly, and

                  (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) technologies or application programs
                  in educational settings to facilitate teaching, learning, or
                  decision making. With the help of AI technologies, which
                  simulate human intelligence to make inferences, judgments, or
                  predictions, computer systems can provide personalized
                  guidance, supports, or feedback to students as well as
                  assisting teachers or policymakers in making decisions.
                  Although AIED has been identiﬁed as the primary research focus
                  in the ﬁeld of computers and education, the interdisciplinary

               of context in the history and evolution of both artiﬁcial
               intelligence and the virtual university. There are histories in
               the terminology as much as what they refer to. Thus, the virtual
               universities that emerged late last century are very different in
               scope and vision compared to contemporary practice. There are
               likewise different theoretical perspectives with Gartner’s “Hype
               Cycle,” one among many methods that provides perspective on the
               stages of AI-driven advances in technological innovation. An
               imperative to foreground questioning of the domain is what frames
               our discussion. One key question among many concerns the
               affordances and challenges that AI presents for a virtual
               university in the coming decades. A university must prepare for
               AI-based auditing of the integrity of its student records. AI can
               help spot plagiarism and fake IDs and support academic integrity.
               Policy-makers might use AI to spot potentially impossible
               situations that could give rise to big penalties. But as AI
               merges into our environment, it is no longer just a tool with new
               ethical and social issues arising. There already exist forms of
               colonial biases embedded into AI and machine learning systems.
               What practical choices exist now? Every virtual university might
               consider collaborating on how to ensure trustworthiness of their
               operational systems that use AI. Emerging public policy such as
               the EU’s Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act provides a legal mechanism
               for building a reliable AI ecosystem. Research and innovation
               into both AI and the kinds of services virtual universities will
               need into the future are now proliferating. Many futures are
               possible. From an educational perspective developing human agency
               through this next era should be a priority. Students could be
               taught how to use AI-supported tools to solve increasingly
               challenging questions. Even more imperative will be the questions
               they ask.},

              of the educational discourse in light of increasing technological
              developments and accessibility of AI systems, e.g. ChatGPT. It is
              our view that bringing together, thinking about and promoting
              Digital-, Data- and AI literacy in teaching is a major concern of
              future education. We focus in particular on teacher education,
              since teachers have a dual role: on the one hand, pre-service
              teachers are also learners who must first develop the appropriate
              competencies themselves, and on the other hand, they are
              multipliers as teachers in schools who must impart the appropriate
              competencies. Particularly in the context of novel generative AI
              systems and large language models, it is important to take a
              holistic and critical-reflective look at them from a
              technological, socio-cultural and user-oriented perspective.},

                  supporting students in achieving their unique learning goals.
                  In recent years, researchers have dedicated efforts to address
                  the challenge of personalizing curriculum through diverse
                  techniques and approaches. However, it is crucial to
                  acknowledge the phenomenon of student forgetting, as
                  individuals exhibit variations in limitations, backgrounds,
                  and goals, as evidenced by studies in the field of learning
                  sciences. This paper introduces the complex issue of fully
                  individualizing a curriculum while considering the impact of
                  student forgetting, presenting a comprehensive framework to
                  tackle this problem. Moreover, we conduct two experiments to
                  explore this issue, aiming to assess the difficulty of
                  identifying relevant curricula within this context and uncover
                  behavioral patterns associated with the problem. The findings
                  from these experiments provide valuable prescriptive
                  recommendations for educational stakeholders seeking to
                  implement personalized approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate
                  the complexity of this problem, highlighting the need for our
                  framework as an initial decision-making tool to address this

                  aims to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and
                  models in analysing these questions gathered by We The
                  Curious. Meanwhile, in AI, there is a lack of tools that focus
                  on processing and analysing the questions. Thus, we introduce
                  a deep neural network called QBERT to process the questions
                  for three tasks: question taxonomy, equivalent question
                  detection, and question answering. Then we apply QBERT to
                  provide an analysis of the questions collected by We The
                  Curious, as well as comprehend Bristolians’ curiosity. Then
                  using QBERT, we categorise the We The Curious questions into
                  90 themes and 5,930 communities. Moreover, 436 questions are
                  answered by one-sentence answers extracted from Wikipedia.},

  abstract     = {It is widely documented that higher education institutional
                  responses to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated not only the
                  adoption of educational technologies, but also associated
                  socio-technical controversies. Critically, while these
                  cloud-based platforms are capturing huge datasets, and
                  generating new kinds of learning analytics, there are few
                  strongly theorised, empirically validated processes for
                  institutions to consult their communities about the ethics of
                  this data-intensive, increasingly algorithmically-powered
                  infrastructure. Conceptual and empirical contributions to this
                  challenge are made in this paper, as we focus on the
                  under-theorised and under-investigated phase required for
                  ethics implementation, namely, joint agreement on ethical
                  principles. We foreground the potential of ethical
                  co-production through Deliberative Democracy (DD), which
                  emerged in response to the crisis in confidence in how typical
                  democratic systems engage citizens in decision making. This is
                  tested empirically in the context of a university-wide DD
                  consultation, conducted under pandemic lockdown conditions,
                  co-producing a set of ethical principles to govern
                  Analytics/AI-enabled Educational Technology (AAI-EdTech).
                  Evaluation of this process takes the form of interviews
                  conducted with students, educators, and leaders. Findings
                  highlight that this methodology facilitated a unique and
                  structured co-production process, enabling a range of higher
                  education stakeholders to integrate their situated knowledge
                  through dialogue. The DD process and product cultivated
                  commitment and trust among the participants, informing a new
                  university AI governance policy. The concluding discussion
                  reflects on DD as an exemplar of ethical co-production,
                  identifying new research avenues to advance this work. To our
                  knowledge, this is the first application of DD for AI ethics,
                  as is its use as an organisational sensemaking process in
                  education.},

                  broad-scale adoption: A technical challenge regarding the need
                  for high-quality models, which is exacerbated for languages
                  with fewer resources than English; a usability challenge in

                  are methods commonly used for learning; however, establishing
                  successful coordination becomes a hurdle in computer-mediated
                  collaborations. The development of systems to facilitate
                  communication activities in such situations has been
                  attempted, but models are still required for capturing
                  learners’ interactions and detecting their quality. This study
                  explored several types of verbal and nonverbal behaviors of
                  learners that can be implemented while designing tutoring
                  systems to effectively capture their interaction processes in
                  scenarios where learners engage in collaborative learning
                  mediated by a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA). This
                  study focused on the degree of behavior recurrence of each
                  speaker, which is considered suitable for observing levels of
                  effectiveness. Specifically, this study focused on three
                  indicators—gaze synchronization, language conformance, and
                  emotional matching through facial expression—to establish a
                  system-based index for measuring learners’ collaborative
                  processes such as synchronization. This study experimentally
                  examined the relationship between these indicators and the
                  performance and process of collaborative learning among 44
                  learners while using PCA for facilitation. Subsequently,
                  numerous dependent variables in the collaborative learning
                  process were predicted using the three proposed indicators.
                  However, no significant correlation was established between
                  learning performance and the indicators used. These findings
                  show that the recurrence of indicators is useful for
                  estimating the collaborative learning process and that these
                  indicators can be used in the development of learning support
                  systems to trace learners’ achievements in successful
                  interactions.},

                  intelligence technologies in education has steadily grown.
                  Many studies have demonstrated the potential of these
                  technologies to improve school administration processes,
                  enhance students' learning experiences, simplify teachers'
                  daily tasks, and broaden opportunities for lifelong learning.
                  However, the enthusiasm surrounding these possibilities may
                  overshadow the ethical challenges posed by these systems. This
                  systematic literature review is designed to explore the
                  ethical dimensions surrounding the utilisation of these
                  technologies within the defined timeframe (2011–022) in the
                  field of education. It undertakes a thorough analysis of

                  on pinpointing any inherent shortcomings within the existing
                  body of literature. The paper discusses how cultural

                  research's blind spots and provides insights to help rethink
                  education ethics in the age of AI. Additionally, the paper

                  a critical role in ensuring the ethical use of AI in
                  education. This review aims to stimulate ethical debates
                  around artificial intelligence that recognise it as a
                  non-neutral tool, and to view it as an opportunity to
                  strengthen the debates on the ethics of education itself.},

                  Framework for K-12 Science Education, requires students to
                  construct and critique arguments, but timely evaluation of
                  arguments in large-scale classrooms is challenging. Recent
                  work has shown the potential of automated scoring systems for
                  open response assessments, leveraging machine learning (ML)
                  and artificial intelligence (AI) to aid the scoring of written
                  arguments in complex assessments. Moreover, research has
                  amplified that the features (i.e., complexity, diversity, and
                  structure) of assessment construct are critical to ML scoring
                  accuracy, yet how the assessment construct may be associated
                  with machine scoring accuracy remains unknown. This study
                  investigated how the features associated with the assessment
                  construct of a scientific argumentation assessment item
                  affected machine scoring performance. Specifically, we
                  conceptualized the construct in three dimensions: complexity,
                  diversity, and structure. We employed human experts to code
                  characteristics of the assessment tasks and score middle
                  school student responses to 17 argumentation tasks aligned to
                  three levels of a validated learning progression of scientific
                  argumentation. We randomly selected 361 responses to use as
                  training sets to build machine-learning scoring models for
                  each item. The scoring models yielded a range of agreements
                  with human consensus scores, measured by Cohen’s kappa (mean =
                  0.60; range 0.38 − 0.89), indicating good to almost perfect
                  performance. We found that higher levels of Complexity and
                  Diversity of the assessment task were associated with
                  decreased model performance, similarly the relationship
                  between levels of Structure and model performance showed a
                  somewhat negative linear trend. These findings highlight the
                  importance of considering these construct characteristics when
                  developing ML models for scoring assessments, particularly for
                  higher complexity items and multidimensional assessments.},

                  digital educational technology has yet to catch up as
                  automated feedback is often provided shallowly. This paper
                  presents a case study on implementing a pipeline that provides
                  German-speaking university students enrolled in an
                  introductory-level educational psychology lecture with
                  content-specific feedback for a lecture assignment. In the
                  assignment, students have to discuss the usefulness and
                  educational grounding (i.e., connection to working memory,
                  metacognition or motivation) of ten learning tips presented in
                  a video within essays. Through our system, students received
                  feedback on the correctness of their solutions and content
                  areas they needed to improve. For this purpose, we implemented
                  a natural language processing pipeline with two steps: (1)
                  segmenting the essays and (2) predicting codes from the
                  resulting segments used to generate feedback texts. As
                  training data for the model in each processing step, we used
                  689 manually labelled essays submitted by the previous student
                  cohort. We then evaluated approaches based on GBERT, T5, and
                  bag-of-words baselines for scoring them. Both pipeline steps,
                  especially the transformer-based models, demonstrated high
                  performance. In the final step, we evaluated the feedback
                  using a randomised controlled trial. The control group
                  received feedback as usual (essential feedback), while the
                  treatment group received highly informative feedback based on
                  the natural language processing pipeline. We then used a six
                  items long survey to test the perception of feedback. We

                  machine learning algorithms in educational settings, focusing
                  on recent studies and their proposed solutions to address
                  biases. Applications analyzed include student dropout
                  prediction, performance prediction, forum post classification,
                  and recommender systems. We identify common strategies, such
                  as adjusting sample weights, bias attenuation methods,
                  fairness through un/awareness, and adversarial learning.
                  Commonly used metrics for fairness assessment include ABROCA,
                  group difference in performance, and disparity metrics. The
                  review underscores the need for context-specific approaches to
                  ensure equitable treatment and reveals that most studies found
                  no strict tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. We recommend
                  evaluating fairness of data and features before algorithmic

                  inputs, expanding the scope of education fairness studies

                  methodologies require that teachers have continuous access to
                  texts that are adequate in terms of topic and language
                  competence. However, the task of finding appropriate materials
                  is arduous and time consuming for teachers. To build on
                  automatic readability assessment research that could help to
                  assist teachers, we explore the performance of natural
                  language processing approaches when dealing with educational
                  science documents for secondary education. Currently,
                  readability assessment is mainly explored in English. In this
                  work we extend our research to Basque and Spanish together
                  with English by compiling context-specific corpora and then
                  testing the performance of feature-based machine-learning and
                  deep learning models. Based on the evaluation of our results,
                  we find that our models do not generalize well although deep
                  learning models obtain better accuracy and F1 in all

  abstract     = {As intelligent textbooks become more ubiquitous in classrooms
                  and educational settings, the need to make them more
                  interactive arises. An alternative is to ask students to
                  generate knowledge in response to textbook content and provide
                  feedback about the produced knowledge. This study develops
                  Natural Language Processing models to automatically provide
                  feedback to students about the quality of summaries written at
                  the end of intelligent textbook sections. The study builds on
                  the work of Botarleanu et al. (2022), who used a Longformer
                  Large Language Model (LLM) to develop a summary grading model.
                  Their model explained around 55\% of holistic summary score
                  variance as assigned by human raters. This study uses a
                  principal component analysis to distill summary scores from an
                  analytic rubric into two principal components – content and
                  wording. This study uses two encoder-only classification large
                  language models finetuned from Longformer on the summaries and
                  the source texts using these principal components explained
                  82\% and 70\% of the score variance for content and wording,
                  respectively. On a dataset of summaries collected on the
                  crowd-sourcing site Prolific, the content model was shown to
                  be robust although the accuracy of the wording model was
                  reduced compared to the training set. The developed models are
                  freely available on HuggingFace and will allow formative
                  feedback to users of intelligent textbooks to assess reading
                  comprehension through summarization in real time. The models
                  can also be used for other summarization applications in
                  learning systems.},

                  emphasized, the practical adoption of adaptive learning
                  environments has been relatively slow. Discussion about
                  underlying reasons for this disparity often centers on factors
                  such as usability, the role of teachers, or privacy concerns.
                  Although these considerations are important, I argue that a
                  key factor contributing to this relatively slow progress is
                  the inherent complexity of developing adaptive learning
                  environments. I focus speciﬁcally on the modeling techniques
                  that provide the foundation for adaptive behavior. The design
                  of these models presents us with numerous challenges, nuances,
                  and trade-offs. Awareness of these challenges is essential for
                  guiding our efforts, both in the practical development of our

                  two main questions: What are our major strengths? And, what
                  new opportunities lay on the horizon? We analyse 47 papers

                  2004, and 2014) to identify the foci and typical scenarios
                  that occupy the field of AIED. We use those results to suggest
                  two parallel strands of research that need to take place in
                  order to impact education in the next 25 years: One is an

                  grounded in postmodern philosophy and is linked to growing
                  debate about reflexivity and voice in social research. The
                  intent of autoethnography is to acknowledge the inextricable
                  link between the personal and the cultural and to make room
                  for nontraditional forms of inquiry and expression. In this

                  understanding regarding autoethnography as a research method
                  and describes the experience of an emerging qualitative

                  understanding. The author’s experience of writing an
                  autoethnography about international adoption has shown her,
                  however, that autoethnography can be a very difficult
                  undertaking. In writing her autoethnography, she confronted
                  anxietyproducing questions pertaining to representation,
                  balance, and ethics. As well, she dealt with the acceptability
                  of her autoethnography by informal and formal reviewers. In
                  this article she discusses the challenges she faced in her

  abstract     = {The profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the
                  modes of teaching and learning necessitates a reexamination of
                  the interrelationships among technology, pedagogy, and subject
                  matter. Given this context, we endeavor to construct a
                  framework for integrating the Technological Pedagogical
                  Content Knowledge of Artificial Intelligence Technology
                  (Artificial Intelligence—Technological Pedagogical Content
                  Knowledge, AI-TPACK) aimed at elucidating the complex
                  interrelations and synergistic effects of AI technology,
                  pedagogical methods, and subject-specific content in the field
                  of education. The AI-TPACK framework comprises seven
                  components: Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Content Knowledge
                  (CK), AI-Technological Knowledge (AI-TK), Pedagogical Content
                  Knowledge (PCK), AI-Technological Pedagogical Knowledge
                  (AI-TCK), AI-Technological Content Knowledge (AI-TPK), and
                  AI-TPACK itself. We developed an effective structural equation
                  modeling (SEM) approach to explore the relationships among
                  teachers’ AI-TPACK knowledge elements through the utilization
                  of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
                  analysis (CFA). The result showed that six knowledge elements
                  all serve as predictive factors for AI-TPACK variables.
                  However, different knowledge elements showed varying levels of
                  explanatory power in relation to teachers’ AI-TPACK. The
                  influence of core knowledge elements (PK, CK, and AI-TK) on
                  AI-TPACK is indirect, mediated by composite knowledge elements
                  (PCK, AI-TCK, and AI-TPK), each playing unique roles.
                  Non-technical knowledge elements have significantly lower
                  explanatory power for teachers of AI-TPACK compared to
                  knowledge elements related to technology. Notably, content
                  knowledge (C) diminishes the explanatory power of PCK and
                  AI-TCK. This study investigates the relationships within the
                  AI-TPACK framework and its constituent knowledge elements. The
                  framework serves as a comprehensive guide for the large-scale
                  assessment of teachers’ AI-TPACK, and a nuanced comprehension
                  of the interplay among AI-TPACK elements contributes to a
                  deeper understanding of the generative mechanisms underlying
                  teachers’ AI-TPACK. Such insights bear significant
                  implications for the sustainable development of teachers in
                  the era of artificial intelligence.},

                  research (DBR) and network analysis of reﬂection papers (n =
                  77), the intervention was evaluated and redesigned. Findings

                  (GAI). The primary objective of the webinar was to deepen
                  teacher educators’ understanding and applications of GAI
                  within the context of teacher education in Ghana and to
                  identify areas requiring additional development. Three hundred
                  and seven participants from a diverse group, including teacher
                  educators, administrators, and in-service teachers
                  participated in the PD session. The session was conducted
                  online via Zoom. The video and audio recordings were
                  transcribed and analyzed thematically using MAXQDA version
                  2022.4. Findings indicate a diverse range of familiarity with
                  GAI among participants. While some expressed knowledge of GAI
                  tools, others were learning about GAI for the first time.
                  Further, the findings showed an increasing curiosity among
                  participants for the inspiring functions of GAI in education,
                  such as automatic scoring, academic writing, assisting
                  teachers with image generation for their classroom practices,
                  etc. The participants demonstrated a willingness to include
                  GAI in their classroom practices and support their students.
                  However, they also identified infrastructural gaps, such as
                  the expense of premium GAI tools, training on GAI promptings,
                  and ethical issues such as transparency, as potential barriers
                  to the successful implementation of GAI in teacher education.
                  Therefore, the study suggests that institutional support
                  should be provided to teacher educators. This support would
                  expand their access to various GAI tools and features. The
                  study further recommends integrating GAI, including
                  explainable GAI and prompt engineering, as a core component of
                  teacher education and continuous professional development
                  programs. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of
                  strengthening educators' skills in innovative assessment
                  practices.},

                  and popularity of digital technologies like artiﬁcial
                  intelligence and the internet of things. While existing
                  research has laid a foundation for conceptualizing smart

                  signiﬁcant gap remains in understanding how to assess a
                  university campus’s ‘smartness’ effectively. The lack of a

                  intelligence opens promising opportunities for the
                  implementation of personalized learning methods in any
                  educational environment. Personalized learning has been
                  conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently
                  become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we
                  propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward
                  personalizing learning materials as part of the complete
                  educational process. We have created a tool within a
                  pre-existing learning management system at a software
                  engineering college that automatically generates learning
                  materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the
                  professor for a particular class. The learning materials were
                  composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the
                  traditional professor style and the other two variations
                  adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday
                  Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three
                  different formats, contained automatically generated
                  multiple-choice questions that students could use to check
                  their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for
                  developing such a tool with the help of large language models
                  using OpenAI’s API and an analysis of the preliminary
                  experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college
                  students studying software engineering at a European
                  university. Participation in the study was optional and on
                  voluntary basis. Each student’s tool usage was quantified, and
                  two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after
                  subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both
                  immediate and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences.
                  The results indicate that students found the multiple variants
                  of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly
                  utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials,
                  they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to
                  other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The
                  most popular feature were the automatically generated
                  quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding.
                  Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions
                  of learning materials leads to an increase in students’ study
                  time, especially for students who have not mastered the topic
                  otherwise. The study’s small sample size of 20 students
                  restricts its ability to generalize its findings, but its
                  results provide useful early insights and lay the groundwork
                  for future research on AI-supported educational strategies.},

  abstract     = {Despite the accumulation of substantial cognitive science
                  research relevant to education, there remains confusion and
                  controversy in the application of research to educational
                  practice. In support of a more systematic approach, we
                  describe the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework.
                  KLI promotes the emergence of instructional principles of high
                  potential for generality, while explicitly identifying
                  constraints of and opportunities for detailed analysis of the
                  knowledge students may acquire in courses. Drawing on research
                  across domains of science, math, and language learning, we
                  illustrate the analyses of knowledge, learning, and
                  instructional events that the KLI framework affords. We
                  present a set of three coordinated taxonomies of knowledge,
                  learning, and instruction. For example, we identify three
                  broad classes of learning events (LEs): (a) memory and fluency
                  processes, (b) induction and refinement processes, and (c)
                  understanding and sense-making processes, and we show how
                  these can lead to different knowledge changes and constraints
                  on optimal instructional choices.},

                  educational scholars with the notion of boundaries,
                  particularly by the concepts of boundary crossing and boundary
                  objects. Although studies on boundary crossing and boundary
                  objects emphasize that boundaries carry learning potential, it
                  is not explicated in what way they do so. By reviewing this

                  boundaries: identification, coordination, reflection, and
                  transformation. These mechanisms show various ways in which

                  the premise that online learning occurs through a network of
                  interconnected learners. The teachers’ role in distributed
                  courses extends to forming such a network by facilitating
                  communication that connects learners and their separate
                  personal learning environments scattered around the Internet.
                  The study reported in this paper examined who fulfilled such
                  an influential role in a particular distributed MOOC – a
                  connectivist course (cMOOC) offered in 2011. Social network
                  analysis was conducted over a sociotechnical network of the
                  Twitter-based course interactions, comprising both human
                  course participants and hashtags; where the latter represented
                  technological affordances for scaling course communication.
                  The results of the week-by-week analysis of the network of
                  interactions suggest that the teaching function becomes
                  distributed among influential actors in the network. As the
                  course progressed, both human and technological actors
                  comprising the network subsumed the teaching functions, and
                  exerted influence over the network formation. Regardless, the
                  official course facilitators preserved a high level of
                  influence over the flow of information in the investigated
                  cMOOC.},

                  of Twitter, and a focus group. Participants noted several

  abstract     = {In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, college students
                  have faced various challenges that could negatively impact
                  their critical thinking abilities due to disruptions to
                  education, increased stress and anxiety, less social
                  interaction, and the advancement of distance learning relying
                  more heavily on digital tools. With the increasing integration
                  of AI technology across sectors, higher education institutions
                  have deployed various AI capabilities for intelligent campuses
                  and modernized teaching. However, how to fully utilize AI
                  capabilities to promote students’ thinking awareness on
                  learning effectiveness is still not clear, as critical
                  thinking is an essential skill set holding significant
                  implications for college students’ development. This research
                  adopts the resource-based theory (RBT) to conceptualize the
                  university as a unified entity of artificial intelligence (AI)
                  resources. It aims to investigate whether AI capabilities can
                  foster critical thinking awareness among students by enhancing
                  general self-efficacy and learning motivation. In particular,
                  it examines the causal relationships between AI capabilities,
                  general self-efficacy, motivation and critical thinking
                  awareness. Primary data was collected through a questionnaire
                  administered to 637 college students. Structural equation
                  modeling was employed to test hypotheses pertaining to
                  causality. The results showed that AI capabilities could
                  indirectly enhance students’ critical thinking awareness by
                  strengthening general self-efficacy and learning motivation,
                  but the effect on critical thinking awareness was not
                  significant. Meanwhile, general self-efficacy significantly
                  affected the formation of learning motivation and critical
                  thinking awareness. This indicates that AI capabilities are
                  able to reshape the cognitive learning process, but its direct
                  influence on thinking awareness needs to be viewed with
                  caution. This study explored the role of AI capabilities in
                  education from the perspective of organizational capabilities.
                  It not only proves how AI facilitates cognition, but also
                  discovered the important mediating role of general
                  self-efficacy and motivation in this process. This finding
                  explains the inherent connections between the mechanism links.
                  Furthermore, the study expands research on AI capabilities
                  research from the technical level to the educational field. It
                  provides a comprehensive and in-depth theoretical explanation
                  theoretically, guiding the practice and application of AI in
                  education. The study is of positive significance for
                  understanding the need for the future development of the
                  cultivation of critical thinking awareness talents needed for
                  future development through AI capabilities in education.},

                  possibility to adapt to different student backgrounds, which
                  is difficult to do in a traditional classroom setting.
                  However, there are mixed results on the effectiveness of
                  adaptivity based on different implementations and contexts. In
                  this paper, we introduce AI adaptivity in the context of a new
                  genre of Intelligent Science Stations that bring intelligent
                  tutoring into the physical world. Intelligent Science Stations
                  are mixed-reality systems that bridge the physical and virtual
                  worlds to improve children’s inquiry-based STEM learning.
                  Automated reactive guidance is made possible by a specialized
                  AI computer vision algorithm, providing personalized
                  interactive feedback to children as they experiment and make
                  discoveries in their physical environment. We report on a
                  randomized controlled experiment where we compare learning
                  outcomes of children interacting with the Intelligent Science
                  Station that has task-loop adaptivity incorporated, compared
                  to another version that provides tasks randomly without
                  adaptivity. Our results show that adaptivity using Bayesian
                  Knowledge Tracing in the context of a mixed-reality system
                  leads to better learning of scientific principles, without
                  sacrificing enjoyment. These results demonstrate benefits of

                  media was also significant; teachers who communicated online
                  reported higher perceived learning than teachers who
                  communicated face-toface. The interaction between formality
                  and communication media was also significant. In the informal
                  environments, online learners perceived their learning to be
                  higher than face-to-face learners, whereas in formal learning
                  environments there was no such difference. These results

                  documented that the reception and understanding of
                  evolutionary theory is highly contingent on local factors such
                  as school systems, cultural traditions, religious beliefs, and
                  language. This has important implications for teaching
                  evolution in primary and secondary schools. No universal
                  strategy can be applied in overcoming the barriers of learning
                  that exist and that are part of the practical and daily life
                  in classrooms all over the world. In light of this, a huge
                  challenge is to make high standard teaching materials ﬁt to
                  speciﬁc target audiences readily available. As more and more
                  schools require teachers to use low cost or free web-based

                  about professional learning from seminal educational research
                  of the past two decades. An argument is presented for a shift

                  lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political
                  interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now
                  need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society
                  where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a
                  pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This
                  study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12
                  education worldwide. We conducted a search pro‑cess following
                  the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179
                  documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy
                  approaches were identified, namely learning experience and
                  theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences
                  in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a
                  particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that
                  significant efforts are being made to design models that frame
                  AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that
                  assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the
                  learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the
                  undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and
                  insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency
                  framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed
                  by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting
                  the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular,
                  per‑sonalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools.
                  Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning
                  of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the
                  teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is
                  co-designed with teachers.},

                  the needs of the current knowledge society. Explorative path
                  analysis and case studies were used to study the potential
                  inﬂuencing factors. Results show that several factors on

                  in education. Especially, teachers who are so-called ‘personal

                  Our society is increasingly integrated with technological
                  systems, of which technological objects, and their function,
                  form a part. Technological literacy in that context implies
                  understanding how knowledge is constituted in technology, and
                  in particular how concrete (objects) and abstract levels
                  (systems) are linked. This article has an educational focus

                  phenomenographic approach, the study explores pupils’
                  experiences of technological systems as embedded in four
                  everyday objects. We identify ﬁve qualitatively different ways

                  seeing objects as part of a process, and seeing objects as

                  systems. As a conclusion, we suggest an educational strategy

  abstract = {This review surveys an emergent methodological trend in
              anthropological research that concerns the adaptation of
              long-standing modes of ethnographic practices to more complex
              objects of study. Ethnography moves from its conventional
              single-site location, contextualized by macro-constructions of a
              larger social order, such as the capitalist world system, to
              multiple sites of observation and participation that cross-cut
              dichotomies such as the "local" and the "global," the "lifeworld"
              and the "system." Resulting ethnographies are therefore both in
              and out of the world system. The anxieties to which this
              methodological shift gives rise are considered in terms of testing
              the limits of ethnography, attenuating the power of fieldwork, and
              losing the perspective of the subaltern. The emergence of
              multi-sited ethnography is located within new spheres of
              interdisciplinary work, including media studies, science and tech­
              nology studies, and cultural studies broadly. Several "tracking"
              strategies that shape multi-sited ethnographic research are
              considered. The review concludes with observations about the
              reflexive persona of the ethnographer as "circum­ stantial
              activist" in which methodological discussions about multi-sited
              re­ search in anthropology are now being developed.},

                  should be the first principle of philosophy because it is

                  theories to analyse the three key paragraphs in the
                  Meditations in which Descartes argues this point. The analysis
                  demonstrates: (1) that Descartes' text contains the traces of
                  significant others and the discourses of his time; (2) that
                  the sequence of thoughts that leads Descartes to his first
                  principle is fundamentally dialogical; (3) that Descartes'
                  self-awareness, which he takes as primary, depends upon his
                  reflecting upon himself from the perspective of a more or less
                  generalized other; and finally (4) that Descartes takes the
                  perspective of the other by reversing his own reactions
                  towards others, such that he reacts to himself in the same way
                  that he previously reacted to others. This reanalysis
                  challenges Cartesian solipsism, arguing that the mind, or
                  selfreflection, is fundamentally social.},

  abstract     = {Our societies have come to be known as knowledge societies in
                  which lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important. In
                  this context, competences have become a much discussed topic.
                  Many documents were published by international organisations (
                  UNESCO , W orld B ank, E uropean C ommission) which enumerated
                  21 st century key competences. The field of learning theories
                  has also experienced advances. Findings from neuroscience have
                  promoted a new understanding of what really happens in the
                  brain when we learn. At the same time, the fact that learning
                  increasingly takes place in virtual communities led G eorge S
                  iemens (2004) to propose connectivism as a learning theory for
                  the digital age. Similarly, R oberto C arneiro (2010)
                  suggested a theory he called generativism which aims at
                  describing collaborative learning with digital technologies
                  and open educational resources. These theories might be better
                  able to describe and explain lifelong learning than classical
                  learning theories. In the field of digital technologies,
                  Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) have recently received a
                  great deal of attention. While Siemens suggested connectivist
                  MOOCs ( cMOOCs ) as the ideal platform for connectivist
                  learning, other forms of MOOCs were also developed. These
                  MOOCs have spread at a breath‐taking pace in the last few
                  years, although it is far from clear to what extent they are
                  based on principles from learning theories and really support
                  learning. These developments will be presented and discussed
                  with respect to their relevance for lifelong learning as an
                  integral part of man's quest for meaning.},

              with three high school science teachers to design a curriculum
              where 112 grade-ten biology students collaboratively developed a
              community wiki about Canadian ecozones and biodiversity issues.
              Students then used the wiki as the primary resource for a
              subsequent inquiry activity. This paper analyzes students’
              contributions to the knowledge base, test performance, and student
              satisfaction to evaluate the efficacy of the KCI model. A new
              method of analysis for collaborative wiki artifacts was developed
              to measure student interaction in the wiki. We found that students
              who were higher contributors to the knowledge base performed
              better on a post-test than students who were measured as low
              contributors. Our findings suggest that the KCI model is a

                  convergence is not a certainty; and (6) innovations involving

                  constructive dialogue within ICT professional development
                  activity. As part of an ICT professional development program,
                  sixteen teachers across eight geographically removed schools
                  participated in an online threaded discussion forum for a
                  school year. Data reported in this paper are generated from
                  the archived posts to a threaded discussion forum and are
                  analysed qualitatively for evidence of community and
                  quantitatively for different forums of feedback (Ma¨ kitalo,
                  Ha¨ kkinen, Leinonen, \& Ja¨ rvela¨ , 2002) and levels of
                  discussion (Jarvela \& Hakkinen, 2002). The ﬁndings suggest
                  evidence of both collegial and critical forms of discussion.
                  Collegial discussion was found to be important in developing
                  and maintaining community while critical discussion was vital
                  for its role in transforming teachers’ beliefs. The data also
                  revealed a number of practical aspects of online environments

  author   = {Kemmis, Stephen},
  abstract = {This article aims to give a ‘societist’ (Schatzki, 2003) account
              of ‘learning.’ It offers a new definition of practice, following
              lines suggested by the practice philosophy and theory of Theodore
              Schatzki (1996, 2002, 2010) and by a theory of ‘practice
              architectures’ offered by Kemmis and Grootenboer (2008). Drawing
              on observations of classrooms, schools and a school district, the
              authors aim to defend three claims. First, they argue, insofar as
              people can be said to ‘learn’ anything at all, people learn only
              language games, activities and practices. Second, from a practice
              theory perspective, they argue that the concept ‘learning’ is a
              descriptive concept, not a substantive concept: it describes the
              state of someone’s level of accomplishment in a language game,
              activity or practice; it is not a distinctive process separate
              from participating in the language game or activity or from
              practising the practice. These two claims lead them to conclude,
              third, that to ‘learn’ is to be ‘stirred in’ to language games,
              activities and practices. The authors draw on examples of learning
              and teaching practices observed in classrooms and described in
              interviews, as well as practices of professional development and
              professional learning, and practices of leadership.},

                  interviews, and archival documents were analyzed. \#Edchat
                  reflected some aspects of a community of practice, including
                  overlap in the description of who belongs, sustained mutual
                  relationships, absences of introductory preamble in the
                  conversations, quick setup of a problem to be discussed, and a

                  explores the relationship between these connection strategies
                  and social capital. Survey data ( N = 450) from a random
                  sample of undergraduate students reveal that only social
                  information-seeking behaviors contribute to perceptions of

                  or close friends do not. We also find that reporting more

  abstract     = {The release of the large language model-based chatbot ChatGPT
                  3.5 in November 2022 has brought considerable attention to the
                  subject of artiﬁcial intelligence, not only to the public.
                  From the perspective of higher education, ChatGPT challenges
                  various learning and assessment formats as it signiﬁcantly
                  reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment
                  functionalities. In particular, ChatGPT might be applied to
                  formats that require learners to generate text, such as
                  bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly, the
                  research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor
                  theses is still a valid learning and assessment format.
                  Correspondingly, in this exploratory study, the ﬁrst author
                  was asked to write his bachelor’s thesis exploiting ChatGPT.
                  For tracing the impact of ChatGPT methodically, an
                  autoethnographic approach was used. First, all considerations
                  on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented in logs, and
                  second, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
                  histories were analyzed and are presented along with the
                  recommendations for students regarding the use of ChatGPT
                  suggested by a common framework. In conclusion, ChatGPT is
                  beneﬁcial for thesis writing during various activities, such
                  as brainstorming, structuring, and text revision. However,
                  there are limitations that arise, e.g., in referencing. Thus,
                  ChatGPT requires continuous validation of the outcomes
                  generated and thus fosters learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
                  valued as a beneﬁcial tool in thesis writing. However, writing
                  a conclusive thesis still requires the learner’s meaningful
                  engagement. Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid
                  learning and assessment format. With further releases of
                  ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected, and
                  the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to
                  time.},

                  discussions of designs are contingent on the specific tools
                  employed. In the analyzed recordings, three different setups
                  are utilized: traditional posters, digital slide-show
                  technologies, and combinations of the two. This range of
                  different setups provides a set of contrasts that make visible
                  the role of technologies in shaping the ways in which the
                  reviews are conducted. The analysis is structured in three
                  themes. First, we examine the sequential organization of
                  digital presentations in relation to the spatial structure of
                  posterbased presentations. Second, the different ways in which
                  shared attention is established in digital, paper-based, and
                  hybrid presentation practices are analyzed. Third, we address
                  partwhole relations—how details in presented materials are put
                  in relation to the overarching project or the presentation as
                  a whole. Taken together, the analyses suggest that the
                  detailed organization of the design review is transformed in
                  subtle yet consequential ways through the introduction of
                  digital slide-show technologies. These transformations are
                  consequential not only locally, for the design review itself,
                  but also for the instructive work that is accomplished through
                  this practice. We conclude by discussing some implications for
                  design, arguing that an increased awareness of how the
                  practice is influenced by the different setups might be key
                  for the proper adaptation of presentation technologies to
                  particular purposes.},

                  which is studying the engagement of young people with dierent
                  aspects of techno-popular culture. The focus is on the young
                  person and the signi®cance of digital technologies in their
                  lives as a whole. Drawing on cultural studies research we are
                  investigating the ways in which the contexts for computer use
                  are structured by the dierent discourses present within the
                  family, and the ways in which these discourses may provide a
                  framing context for children's interactions with digital
                  technology. Drawing on socio-cultural research we take the
                  view that learning is learning to do something with a cultural
                  or cognitive tool. Our analysis of data from case studies of
                  16 families shows that the context of home computer use
                  amongst young people is far from a simple and uniform
                  phenomenon and is structured by the dierent discourses
                  present within the family. What young people learn through
                  interaction with computers is thus as much framed by the
                  context of use as by the aordance of the technology. 7 2000

                  as ill-ﬁtting? This article explores discourses that structure
                  the Vision II science classroom, and how different students
                  construct their identities inside these discourses. In the
                  article we consider school science as an order of discourses
                  which restricts and enables what is possible to think and say
                  and what subject-positions those are available and
                  non-available. The results show that students’ talk about a
                  SSI about body and health is constituted by several
                  discourses. We have analyzed how school science discourse,
                  body discourse and general school discourse are structuring
                  the discussions. But these discourses are used in different
                  ways depending on how the students construct their identities
                  in relation to available subject positions, which are
                  dependent on how students at the same time are ‘‘doing’’
                  gender and social class. As an example, middle class girls
                  show resistance against SSI-work since the practice is
                  threatening their identity as ‘‘successful students’’. This
                  article uses a sociopolitical perspective in its discussions
                  on inclusion and exclusion in the practice of Vision II. It
                  raises critical issues about the inherited complexity of SSI
                  with meetings and/or collisions between discourses. Even if
                  the empirical results from this qualitative study are situated
                  in speciﬁc cultural contexts, they contribute with new
                  questions to ask concerning SSI and Vision II school science.},

                  Soviet psychologists havefound it extremely difficult to
                  define it clearly. This concept wasfirst suggested by Lev
                  Vygotsky as a theoretical remedyfor psychological systems that
                  tautologically "explained" phenomena of consciousness through
                  the concept of consciousness. Vygotsky's disciples, notably
                  Alexei Leontiev, departed from the original concept of their
                  teacher. The demarcation line separating Vygotsky's theory
                  from that of Leontiev occurred in the evaluation of the
                  relative importance of semiotic mediation andpractical
                  actionsfor the development of intelligence. Currently there is
                  a revival of interest in the problem of activity both in the

                  technological complexity) were hypothesized to have direct and

                  (e.g., gender, age, and course of study) had any effect on the
                  attitudes. Data were collected from 419 pre-service teachers
                  through a self-report questionnaire and analysed using the

                  64\% of the variance in attitudes towards computer use was

  abstract     = {In this paper social semiotics, and systemic functional
                  linguistics in particular, are used in order to identify
                  registers of digital literacy in the use of virtual learning
                  environments. The framework of social semiotics provides means
                  to systemize and discuss digital literacy as a linguistic and
                  semiotic issue. The following research question was
                  investigated in the paper: What different registers of digital
                  literacy could be identiﬁed when students and teachers
                  communicate and interact in a VLE? The research question was
                  answered by, initially, an application of social semiotics to
                  virtual learning environments, and its relation to the
                  knowledge domains of everyday, specialized and reﬂexive
                  digital literacy. This application was then further developed,
                  using an analysis of a course speciﬁc use of a virtual
                  learning environment in a case study. The study identiﬁed
                  discrepancies between the digital literacies of teachers,
                  designers and students. These discrepancies mean that a shared
                  semiotic register was sometimes difﬁcult to maintain. The
                  conclusion is that the designers and teachers as co-designers
                  of virtual learning environments need a better understanding
                  of everyday digital literacy in order to design more sufﬁcient
                  learning environments. The paper shows that digital literacy
                  must be considered as a situated practice, and that it
                  concerns functional and communicative competencies rather than
                  acquiring a set of technical skills.},

  abstract = {The pervasiveness of technology in nearly every aspect of lives is
              shaping trends of teaching and learning in higher education.
              Faculty members are constantly trying to keep up with diverse
              needs of students who exist in a world driven and purposed by
              technology. The dilemma that most faculty members face is how to
              access professional development opportunities that fits into their
              busy teaching, research and service schedule. Because of the
              inability at times to access professional development sessions
              when offered many faculty are resistant to try out new approaches
              for fear of failing or being perceived as incompetent by peers and
              students. Because of this dilemma, many faculty members are
              requiring personalized professional development on the integration
              of technology in their teaching methods. The literature review
              revealed that there is no universal definition for mentoring.
              Mentoring can be used to add value to faculty development; power
              dynamics must be considered in the mentoring relationship; these
              relationships call for ethical as well as general good practices

                  disengaged from education and learning to connect to lifelong
                  learning practices. These youngsters constitute a considerable
                  social problem in Europe and the aim of the project is to find
                  ways to recover the intrinsic motivation to learn and thereby
                  improve the opportunities for participation. Key in this
                  innovative strategy is selforganized learning, the learner in
                  control of the learning process. The paper starts with an
                  introduction on the challenge these dropouts pose to the
                  society at large and the learning strategy developed to cope
                  with this matter. The usage of media in the methodology is
                  crucial and links to the concept of a user-configurable
                  Personal Learning Environment (PLE). The main research issues
                  are: can reAct change the attitude, what are the benefits and
                  drawbacks of this self-organized learning approach and do the

  abstract = {This paper criticizes the argument that video games by their
              nature are good learning environments. By applying the ecological
              approach to perception and learning to examples of game play, the
              paper shows that games can be designed so that players are able to
              see and utilize affordances without developing skills. Compared to
              other practices, gaming demands less learning of the practitioner
              since progress can be built into the system. Contrary to the
              arguments put forth by James Paul Gee in his book What video games
              have to teach us about learning and literacy, this paper comes to
              the conclusion that good games do not necessarily imply good

  abstract = {This four-year, cross-sectional study, situated in one U.S.
              university, investigated 206 preservice teachers’ use of social
              network services (SNS) in teacher preparation and their
              dispositions toward using SNS in their future teaching. Using
              descriptive survey methodology, results revealed nearly all
              preservice teachers used a general SNS (e.g., Facebook), but about
              40\% never read blogs, wrote blogs, or read wikis; about 90\%
              never wrote wikis, and about 80\% never read/ wrote Twitter. SNS
              users consumed/read more content than they created and/or shared.
              Use of SNS for professional activities rose from 7\% to 22\%.
              Trends indicated general SNS (e.g., Facebook) and Twitter use was
              mostly personal, while reading blogs, wikis, and writing blogs was
              equally personal and educational, and writing wikis was mostly
              educational. The majority of these preservice teachers put “a lot”
              of restrictions on their SNS accounts. The likelihood that
              preservice teachers felt they would use social networking in their
              future teaching reduced. Discussion (a) examines how teacher
              education programs prepare new teachers as learners and designers
              of new technologies and (b) describes a sequence of SNS
              experiences that may develop preservice teachers as learners,

              three forms of communication concentrating on the topic of ICT in

              face-to-face interaction, mediated interaction, and mediated
              quasi-interaction. Based on case study data and participating
              teachers’ self evaluation, during the course of the project, the
              use of ICT in science teaching increased. As predicted,
              face-to-face communication appeared to be felt more effective than

              with peers and students. Social interaction powerfully shapes
              teachers’ affective and cognitive flexibility in adapting their

              communication tools that increase teachers’ interactions and

              development through social constructs. It then summarizes a study
              of teachers’ first interaction with a school weblog to assess
              whether their perceptions confirm a sense of community
              conversation and value. Regardless of their experience prior to
              the use of the weblog, teachers reported ease in using it.
              Moreover, they felt it was an important tool for campus
              communication. Teachers also felt that professional use of tools
              leads to higher adoption in classroom practice. This paper
              concludes by considering implications of the survey results and

                  takes a socio-genetic approach to tracing the ways technology
                  becomes part of classroom mathematical activity. It
                  illuminates the reﬂexive processes of inscription, translation
                  and re-inscription as technologies evolve by examining the
                  development and classroom use of Texas Instruments’
                  TI-NspireTM. To investigate the development and use of
                  TI-Nspire, research from the ﬁeld of Science and Technology
                  Studies is drawn on that provides insights into the

                  avoiding essentialist positions that obscure either
                  technological or human aspects of the relationship. The
                  ﬁndings show that rather than being a linear process where the
                  technology is passed from developer to teacher to student, the
                  development and use of TI-Nspire involves multiple feedback
                  loops with constant reconﬁguration. These loops occur at
                  several levels as teachers and students integrate the
                  technology into their mathematical activity and these

                  (ICT). Several key issues are explored, including the effects
                  of ICT on teaching and learning, the changing role of the
                  teacher in constructivist learning environments, and the new
                  skills teachers may be expected to acquire in order to make
                  fruitful use of the new technologies. The author argues that
                  the introduction of ICT into schools is raising fundamental
                  questions about the nature of teaching and learning, and may
                  even be challenging our conception of 'time and place'. The
                  paper offers evaluation of ICT uses in elementary schools in
                  the USA and primary schools in England. It concludes with

                  organizations, and how learning in school can lead to learning

               discourse. The scientific categories are built into a web-based
               discussion forum (Fle) as part of a pedagogical and technological
               design. The scientific categories are based on the concepts of
               the progressive inquiry model for knowledge building.
               Socio-cultural theory with a focus on concepts like categories
               and prompting is our theoretical framework. In the DoCTA NSS
               project we have used the progressive inquiry model to explore how
               the students use categories to collaboratively build new
               understanding of a specific knowledge domain. Based on the
               theoretical framework and an empirical example, we argue that the
               progressive inquiry model – in its conceptual form - is too
               rationalistic for student knowledge building. We found that
               student knowledge building is task-specific and local oriented,

  abstract     = {Abstract Despite its continuing popularity as the social
                  network site par excellence, the educational value of F
                  acebook has not been fully determined, and results from the
                  mainstream educational paradigms are contradictory, with some
                  scholars emphasizing its pedagogical affordances (e.g.,
                  widening context of learning, mixing information and learning
                  resources, hybridization of expertise) and others cautioning
                  against its use for educational purposes. Moreover, systematic
                  reviews about documented educational usage of F acebook as a
                  learning environment are lacking. This article attempts to
                  provide a critical overview of current studies focusing on the
                  use of F acebook as a technology‐enhanced learning
                  environment, with the aim of exploring the extent to which its
                  pedagogical potential is actually translated into practice.
                  Only empirical studies published in peer‐reviewed academic
                  journals with a specific focus on F acebook as a learning
                  environment have been considered for the review. The authors
                  conducted a comprehensive literature search that identified 23
                  relevant articles that were subsequently analysed according to
                  a simplified list of guidelines. These articles were further
                  analysed and recoded through a set of emerging categories. The
                  results show that pedagogical affordances of F acebook have
                  only been partially implemented and that there are still many
                  obstacles that may prevent a full adoption of F acebook as a
                  learning environment such as implicit institutional, teacher
                  and student pedagogies, and cultural issues. Finally, a broad
                  observation on the implications of the study is developed with
                  some suggestions for future research.},

  author   = {Persson, Anders},
  abstract = {Excessive generosity with information about one's private life or
              the private lives of others, known as ”oversharing”, appears to be
              an oft-noted phenomenon in the context of ”new” media. I have
              previously studied this phenomenon in connection with mobile phone
              conversations in public places. After having eavesdropped on, or
              maybe rather overheard, such conversations more systematically, I
              offered a number of different explanations for the intimacy that
              occasionally results from these conversations: Were such mobile
              phone users to be regarded as inconsiderate individualists, or as
              communicating exhibitionists, or as absorbed communicators? It is
              against this background that I am studying, in this paper,
              oversharing in the context of social media such as Facebook, and
              attempting to answer the question: What is it in ”social media” as
              media and in the communicative situation of the person using them
              that constitutes front- and backstage and the border dividing
              them? The paper consists of a comparative analysis of face-to-face
              interaction and interaction in social media in which I use
              Goffman's terms ”front- and backstage” and ”expressions given and
              expressions given off.” The two forms of interaction are also
              compared based on Goffman's system model of communication, which
              consists of eight different system requirements and system
              constraints. The results of the comparison between face-to-face
              interaction and interaction in social media has to do with
              differences in the natures of the two forms of interaction. When
              it comes to the communicative situation in which social media
              users find themselves, it appears to be paradoxical: on the one
              hand, the users can present themselves in a highly controlled
              manner while, on the other hand, the risk of oversharing appears
              to be great.},

                for students. Grades are the only criteria used for selecting
                students as they leave compulsory school and apply for
                upper-secondary school. When students apply for higher
                education, selection is also made based on the "Swedish
                Scholastic Aptitude Test", but a minimum of one third of the
                seats (often more) are based on grades. Given that it is the
                individual teacher who synthesizes students' performances into a
                grade, and that the reliability of teachers' grades has been
                questioned (e.g., Swedish National Agency of Education (SNAE),
                2019), this is a problematic situation which can potentially
                have a significant influence on the lives of thousands of
                students each year. Measures have been taken to increase the
                agreement in teachers' grading, most recently by legally
                requiring that teachers in primary and secondary education take
                results from national tests "into consideration" when grading.
                This relatively loose strategy of taking test results "into
                consid-eration" has not yet yielded any observable change in
                teachers' grades, however, and there is still a large
                discrepancy between teacher-assigned grades and test results for
                most subjects (SNAE, 2019) 1. For example, the proportion of
                students whose grades correspond to their test results varies
                between 61-73 percent in the various subjects. Furthermore, it
                is more common that the teacher-assigned grades are higher than
                the test results, as compared to the other way around (with the
                exception of English as a foreign language, EFL). There are also
                gender differences, where girls to a slightly higher degree than
                boys receive grades that are higher in comparison with their
                test results. There are also large variations between schools.},

                  from social media companies making data available to
                  researchers through their application programming interfaces
                  (APIs). An API is a back-end interface through which
                  third-party developers may connect new add-ons to an existing
                  service. The API is also an interface for researchers to
                  collect data off a given social media service for empirical
                  analysis. Presenting a critical methodological discussion of
                  the opportunities and challenges associated with quantitative
                  and qualitative social media research based on APIs, this
                  article highlights a number of general methodological issues
                  to be dealt with when collecting and assessing data through

              principles of self-directed learning (SDL), were explored in a
              controlled trial with 46 staff members in a mid-sized K-8 school
              district. Participants engaged with four technology tools via two
              sessions of independent exploration and two sessions of
              facilitated classes. The impacts of these two approaches were
              examined through measures of teacher knowledge, levels of
              technology integration, and teachers’ perceptions of
              effectiveness. Participants showed preference for differentiation
              of PD delivery method based on previous knowledge of the topic,
              time requirements, and engagement. Analysis showed no
              statistically significant difference between delivery method and
              knowledge-gained for five of the individual technology tools that
              were utilized in this study, but did show a statistically
              significant relationship for one tool, indicating a larger
              increase in knowledge via the independent exploration method.
              Teacher self-report data showed a slight preference for the
              independent exploration model, though the relationship was not
              statistically significant. These findings may be practically
              valuable for technology PD designers as they develop technology PD
              for teachers.},

  abstract     = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are often examined and
                  evaluated in terms of institutional cost, instructor prestige,
                  number of students enrolled, and completion rates. MOOCs,
                  which are connecting thousands of adult learners from diverse
                  backgrounds, have yet to be viewed from a learning culture
                  perspective. This research used virtual ethnographic methods
                  to investigate the adult learner experience in a MOOC learning
                  culture. Speciﬁcally, authors observed and interviewed twelve
                  adult learners from countries around the world to gain a
                  richer understanding of their online experiences and
                  interactions within a MOOC focused on the social justice topic
                  of human trafﬁcking. Results showed that while a MOOC learning
                  culture has some similarities to traditional distance
                  education environments, it is indeed complex due to the large
                  global scale. Based on the six themes that emerged from the
                  data, the authors present the concept of MOOCocracy—a social
                  learning democracy, as a description of the MOOC learning
                  culture. Implications for MOOC instructional design are also

  abstract     = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine how school
                  teachers in the United States (US) perceived using Twitter as
                  a means for professional development, engagement in
                  communities of practice, and any benefits or drawbacks to
                  participating in Twitter. Method: This qualitative research
                  utilized an embedded case design with three sources of data:
                  (a) three consecutive months of tweet data from late 2011
                  archived on the host website, relating to \#EdChat, a weekly
                  online chat in Twitter about education issues; (b) interviews
                  with 19 school teachers in the US who participated in the
                  \#EdChat online discussions in Twitter; and (c) Twitter bio
                  and Tweet data of the 19 teachers interviewed. All data were
                  entered into NVIVO (QSR International Pty. Ltd., Doncaster,
                  Australia) for content thematic coding, and The Communities of
                  Practice and Connectivist Conceptual Framework was used to
                  inform this analysis. The researchers’ interpretations were
                  verified with participants, and data triangulated across all
                  sources to strengthen confidence in the results. Results: Five
                  main themes and 17 subthemes emerged from the data across all
                  sources. The main themes were teachers’ perceptions of sharing
                  knowledge and resources, Twitter promoting a sense of
                  belonging, Twitter providing meaningful professional
                  development, and teachers’ views on the technical benefits and
                  drawbacks of using Twitter. Conclusion: Regardless of years
                  teaching, subject area, or age, educators perceived Twitter as
                  providing an online forum to reflect upon practice, exchange
                  knowledge and experience, and be in the presence of supportive
                  colleagues. While participants experienced the pace and volume
                  of information as being overwhelming at times, educators
                  developed skills to managing this and perceived discussions to
                  be learner-centered and supportive. Teachers valued the sense
                  of community and learning that they reported were not
                  otherwise available in their own physical workplace. Overall,
                  participants perceived that the benefits of participation in
                  online Twitter chats for learning outweighed any drawbacks
                  experienced. This article includes implications for future
                  research and how social network sites may be used as a
                  supportive venue for educators, therapists, and students,
                  including individuals with disabilities.},

                  follows a top-down transmission model. Whether they follow a
                  behaviourist, cognitivist or constructivist path, teachers
                  guide or dictate activities as well as provide information
                  that learners use in learning. In most cases, learners are not
                  treated as sources of knowledge but as recipients or, at best,
                  constructors of it. This is a waste of the vast pools of
                  skills and knowledge that inevitably exist in any large
                  collection of learners and is diametrically opposed to the
                  principles behind earlier but now less commonplace
                  connectivist MOOCs (cMoocs). Such cMOOCs, at least in
                  principle, benefit from scale – they gain value the more
                  people there are engaged in them because, though they coalesce
                  around shared events and resources that resemble the
                  instructivist patterns of publication, learners generate and
                  design their own learning paths, discussing, debating, sharing
                  their learning in rich networks and clusters of networks. As
                  part of a strategy to explore different approaches to MOOC
                  delivery, we developed a site using the Elgg social media
                  framework in order to attempt to gain benefits of social
                  sharing to support learning. Participating in the Digital Age,
                  a six-week Australian MOOC (PDA MOOC), self-referentially was
                  concerned with learning to be a digital citizen while using
                  participatory tools to do so. In this paper we report on the
                  theoretical foundations of the design, its technical
                  implementation, and the benefits and disadvantages of the
                  approach when the course was run.},

                  studies of collaborative projects involving LIS academics and
                  practitioners in Italy. Analysis of interviews and texts was

                  The results suggest similarities between the collaborative

                  situate it in relation to the so-called ‘crisis of
                  representation’, and describe ﬁve loosely conﬁgured categories

                curriculum that was codesigned in close partnership with
                teachers, technology specialists and even school administrators.
                The goal of the research was to provide empirical support for a
                recent model of learning and instruction that blends the two
                perspectives of knowledge communities and scaffolded inquiry. A
                design-oriented method was employed, where the first iteration
                of the curriculum was evaluated in terms of its fit to the
                model, as well as its impact on student learning. Based on a set
                of design recommendations, a much more substantive curriculum
                was developed for the second iteration, leading to rich measures
                of student collaboration and deep understanding of the targeted
                science concepts. This paper describes our co-design process,
                which allowed teachers to lead the curriculum design and
                classroom enactment while researchers contributed design
                guidelines according to the theoretical model.},

                however, the pervasiveness of social media construction
                typically associated with “Web 2.0” represents a new context for
                researching learning and instruction. This chapter reports two
                studies that used a wiki to deliver a new curriculum model that
                blends scripted inquiry activities with collaborative knowledge
                construction in secondary school biology. The researchers
                collaborated with three experienced science teachers to create
                engaging curricula where four classes of grade-ten biology
                collaboratively developed a community wiki about human
                physiology and biodiversity. Students then used the wiki as a
                primary resource for subsequent inquiry activities. We analyzed
                student achievement and engagement with the curriculum to
                evaluate the success of the model. The findings suggest that a
                carefully designed scripted activity can complement and enhance

              researchers could not adopt the same practice in carrying out

              place to conduct research with online gamblers, the paper examines
              the (i) methodological issues in online gambling research, (ii)

              online researchers in the gambling studies field are likely to
              face concern ethical issues (informed consent, deception, public
              versus private spaces, lurking). Despite such ethical dilemmas,

                  significance has become increasingly muted. In this article it
                  is argued that both concepts are important ingredients of a
                  behavioral theory of (organizational) learning. To support
                  this argument, the development of both concepts is traced to
                  the work of Gregory Bateson. In Bateson's thinking, the two
                  concepts have a firm base in dyadic behavior and interaction.

                  barriers which cannot be crossed yet. Linguistics is still
                  described at the level of Chomsky’s view of language
                  competence. Modelling competence-in-performance requires a
                  holistic model, such as the Mixed Game Model (Weigand 2010),
                  which is capable of addressing the challenge of the
                  ‘architecture of complexity’ (Simon 1962). The complex cannot
                  be ‘the ontology of the world’ (Russell and Norwig 2016).
                  There is no autonomous ontology, no hierarchy of concepts; it
                  is always human beings who perceive the world. ‘Anything’, in
                  the end, depends on the human brain.},

  abstract  = {It is hardly possible to overestimate how important teaching and
               learning materials are for teachers’ work and students’ learning.
               Decades of research point to how textbooks are central to
               students’ opportunities to develop new knowledge. This is the
               case all over the world, particularly in countries such as
               Sweden, where the national curriculum leaves much space for
               teachers to plan and develop their own teaching. This
               independence makes the enacted curriculum strongly influenced by
               local contextual conditions and highly supported by textbooks. As
               in all professional practices, certain tools and artifacts have a
               more prominent and supporting role, and it is without a doubt
               that textbooks are one of the most important tools in education.
               This chapter focuses on the ongoing transition from printed
               textbooks to digital textbooks and is based on observations from
               a two-year research project undertaken by the authors. The
               project was conducted in collaboration with 16 secondary school
               teachers to co-facilitate teaching with digital textbooks and
               develop scientific knowledge within the field. The intention is
               to contribute to a comprehension of how digital textbooks are
               integrated with instruction, as well as to mirror this in
               relation to four transformations affecting classrooms and

                the present, it provides two historical examples of how such an
                analysis can be performed. The purpose in using different-level
                cases is to demonstrate how a disentanglement of embedded
                imaginaries and problematisations can be done with both a
                discursive and a technological focus. The analysis shows how one
                ground on which education is made ‘AI-ready’ is through
                imaginaries of risk, transparency and quality assessment.
                Digital systems are materialised proposals intended to realise
                justice, but as they make judgements based on more and more
                data, they also construe increased suspicion and administrative
                costs. Efforts at making everyone and everything AI-ready are
                the result of certain historically defined imaginaries (e.g., of
                AI as neutral efficient control systems, and that the rapid rate
                of technological change requires constantly updated knowledge).
                Entanglements of rapid technological social change and the need
                for more education create a circular argument where the imagined
                (AI-augmented) future is seen as both the reason for and the
                result of more education, and as such accelerates these
                tendencies. Using education as a form of governance is thus a
                potent way of making such imaginaries into realities.},

                for understanding why digitalization is part of a significant
                change of how we know and how we come to know. The
                transformation in how we document experiences and access
                know-how and information that follows from digitalization has
                consequences for educational practices and the reproduction of
                knowledge in all parts of society. Traditional schooling and
                instruction, rooted in print-technology, built on the assumption
                that educational institutions and teachers had control over
                information and knowledge. In evaluations of what had been
                learnt, the teaching and the textbooks provided the material
                that should be reproduced and later evaluated through tests. In
                digital environments, individuals have access to information,
                knowledge and problem-solving strategies that extend their
                knowing far beyond what they are able to reproduce in the
                classical test situation. It is argued that our cognitive
                capacities and skills are becoming increasingly hybrid in nature
                as we learn to engage with increasingly powerful symbolic
                technologies that not only amplify our capacities for thinking

                within a highly marketised public education and edtech sector.
                Analytically, we build on conceptualisations from science and
                technology studies and infrastructure studies to examine the
                platform infrastructural dynamics and the powers produced as
                they sociotechnically entangle with local edtech markets, policy

                raised is what differences are produced across school forms and
                what this implies for teachers’ work, as these powers involve
                repair work and infrastructuring in the form of standards,
                policies and manual work. Ethnographically and computationally,

                instruction. These efforts travel under different names, but
                they share associations with the popular umbrella category,
                digital literacy. This chapter traces the multivalent meanings
                attached to this term: as practices for empowering learners to
                (1) use digital media effectively; (2) protect themselves from
                online exploitation; and (3) cultivate their capacities for work
                in emerging platform economies. It then considers how the term’s
                enduring appeal hinges on categorical conflations: first, of
                complex sociotechnical assemblages as ‘texts’, amenable to
                agentive use or resistance from individual users, and, second,
                of corporate ‘future of work’ imaginaries as inevitable ends
                that education ought to serve. Rather than obviating the project
                of media education, we argue that the shortcomings of ‘digital
                literacy’ suggest a shift in idiom – from ‘literacy’ to
                ‘ecology’ – and offer an alternate orientation from which
                educators might shape a pedagogical programme keyed to the
                social, technical and political-economic imperatives that drive
                platform ecosystems in and beyond education. We conclude by
                highlighting emerging research and resources that can contribute

                  implications of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on
                  human values, with a particular focus on fair outcomes.
                  Existing design frameworks and regulations for ensuring
                  fairness in AI are too general and impractical. Instead, we
                  advocate for understanding fairness as situated in practice,
                  shaped by practitioners' values, allowing stakeholders control
                  in the situation. To accomplish this, the paper contributes by
                  conceptually exploring a potential synergy by combining
                  Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) and Meta-Design. By
                  doing so, human activities can be transformed to deal with
                  challenges, in this case, those emerging from adaptive AI
                  tools. While professional software developers are essential
                  for making significant changes to the tool and providing
                  solutions, users' involvement is equally important. Users are
                  domain experts when it comes to determining practical
                  solutions and aligning structures with their work practices.
                  CHAT contributes through its emphasis on context, history, and
                  mediation by tools. This enables a critical analysis of
                  activity systems, helping to reveal underlying contradictions
                  and identify areas where improvements or innovations are
                  necessary. Meta-Design provides design concepts and
                  perspectives that aim to empower participants, allowing them
                  to actively shape the processes of tool design to align with
                  their specific local needs and evolving conceptions of
                  fairness in use-time. This offers an approach to empowering
                  people and promoting more fair AI design.},

  abstract     = {Considering the increasing importance of Artiﬁcial
                  Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the absence of a
                  comprehensive review on it, this research aims to conduct a
                  comprehensive and systematic review of inﬂuential AIEd
                  studies. We analyzed 45 articles in terms of annual
                  distribution, leading journals, institutions, countries/
                  regions, the most frequently used terms, as well as theories
                  and technologies adopted. We also evaluated deﬁnitions of AIEd
                  from broad and narrow perspectives and clariﬁed the
                  relationship among AIEd, Educational Data Mining,
                  Computer-Based Education, and Learning Analytics. Results
                  indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing
                  interest in and impact of AIEd research; 2) little work had
                  been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into
                  educational contexts; 3) traditional AI technologies, such as
                  natural language processing were commonly adopted in
                  educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were
                  rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both
                  employ AI technologies and engage deeply with educational
                  theories. Findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential
                  of applying AI in physical classroom settings; 2) spare
                  efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between
                  learners’ answers and the desired conceptual understanding
                  within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to
                  the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as
                  generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4)
                  seek the potential of NLP in promoting precision or
                  personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and
                  imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target
                  at issues regarding learners’ during the learning process; and
                  6) closely incorporate the application of AI technologies with
                  educational theories.},

                  form of communicative interaction exists and, if so, how many
                  moves it would require. In conversation analysis, the response
                  to these questions has traditionally been that such a form
                  exists and that it takes the form of a pair of adjacent
                  utterances consisting of a ﬁrst pair part (e.g., a greeting or
                  a question) and a second pair part (e.g., a greeting in return
                  or an answer to the question). Severinson Eklundh and Linell
                  acknowledged that communicative exchanges could take the form
                  of two-part sequences, but they argued that this format is
                  relatively limited in scope. Instead, they proposed that the
                  basic format for most communicative interactions is a
                  three-part sequence and that this structure should not be
                  reduced to a base pair with a sequence closing third as an
                  expansion of the pair. This issue has been the subject of
                  ongoing debate over the last four decades. In this article, we
                  discuss how conversation analysis and extended dialogism have
                  addressed the idea of a minimal form of communicative
                  interaction. We review different approaches and how they
                  overlap and diverge, and we make conceptual distinctions to
                  account for their differences.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the complex challenges of co-designing
                  an AI- and learning analytics (LA)-integrated learning
                  management system (LMS). While co-design has been proposed as
                  a human-centred design approach for scaling AI and LA
                  adoption, our understanding of how these design processes play
                  out in real-life settings remains limited. This study is based
                  on ethnographic fieldwork in primary and secondary schools and
                  employs a relational materialist approach to trace, visualise,
                  and analyse the increasingly complex and transformative
                  relations between a growing number of actors. The findings
                  shed light on the intricate ecosystem in which AI and LA are
                  being introduced and on the marketisation of K-12 education.
                  Instead of following a rational and sequential approach that
                  can be easily executed, the co-design process emerged as a
                  series of events, shifting from solely generating ideas with
                  teachers to integrating and commercialising the LMS into a
                  school market with an already high prevalence of educational
                  technology (EdTech). AI and LA in education, co-design and
                  data-driven schooling served as negotiating ideas, boundary
                  objects, which maintained connectivity between actors, despite
                  limited AI and LA implementation and the development of a
                  stand-alone app. Even though teachers and students were
                  actively involved in the design decisions, the co-design
                  process did not lead to extensive adoption of the LMS nor did
                  it sufficiently address the ethical issues related to the
                  unrestricted collection of student data.},

                  competence. This paper reports on the findings of a study in
                  which 41 teachers from three lower secondary schools in Sweden
                  engaged in focus group interviews where they participated in
                  sensemaking processes on students’ digital competence. The
                  questions targeted what the teachers knew of their students’
                  digital experiences and how to facilitate and further develop
                  these students’ digital competence. Based on the focus group
                  interviews, four themes were identified: critical awareness,
                  tool management, creativity, and avoidance of digital usage.
                  Absent were themes related to democratic digital citizenship.
                  The paper discusses the importance of moving away from a
                  one-sided focus on individual teachers’ professional digital
                  competence in favour of focusing on how school organizations
                  can negotiate and facilitate students’ digital competence in

                  students’ cross-curricular digital competence and digital
                  citizenship. This paper is a starting point for further
                  research on how school as an organization can support teachers
                  in facilitating various areas of students’ digital competence

  abstract     = {Under the constructivist learning paradigm, which emphasises
                  authenticity as a required condition for learning, distance
                  educators have been striving to create authentic learning
                  environments that reflect the real world. However, it is
                  inevitably challenging to make an online learning environment
                  authentic for learners when it is ultimately separated from
                  their real-life contexts. Particularly, in online doctoral
                  education, given the diversity among online learners, even
                  defining “what is real and to whom” is a difficult task. This
                  paper argues that the epistemological approach to authentic
                  learning, based on the constructivist learning paradigm, is
                  not sufficient to make online learning “authentically”
                  meaningful. The paper introduces an alternative, ontological
                  approach stemming from the transformative learning paradigm,
                  and suggests autoethnography as one authentic learning
                  activity that can effectively integrate the epistemological
                  and ontological approaches to authentic learning in online
                  doctoral education. Such a comprehensive conceptualisation of
                  authentic learning, as an integrated process of both knowing
                  and becoming, allows each doctoral student to become a more
                  authentic self across their learning and living environments.},

                  autoethnography methodology, a nontraditional and reflective
                  approach, in educational technology research. Autoethnography
                  involves a critical analysis of personal experiences and
                  stories being positioned within the larger cultural,
                  political, and social context. Following an overview of the
                  origin and development of autoethnography as empirical
                  research, the authors discuss autoethnography in the context
                  of educational technology research by considering its
                  epistemological and methodological issues. In this paper, the
                  authors also consider autoethnography and its relationship to
                  other qualitative research approaches. Essential components
                  and summarized evaluation criteria for novice
                  autoethnographers are shared. Lastly, the paper reflects on
                  the potential benefits as well as the challenges that those
                  writing an autoethnography will inevitably face. There is a
