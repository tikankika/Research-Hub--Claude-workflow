The paper will follow a trajectory that starts in the 1960s and discuss how ethnography was established and consolidated in educational research in Sweden. The paper discerns five phases of formation, starting in the late 1960s through to today. The unilateral relation to Anglo-American ethnographic networks is discussed. An actor network metaphor is used as a tool in the interpretation of the process. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the knowledge of ethnographic research as well as the pro"

As part of an ICT professional development program, sixteen teachers across eight geographically removed schools participated in an online threaded discussion forum for a school year. Data reported in this paper are generated from the archived posts to a threaded discussion forum and are analysed qualitatively for evidence of community and quantitatively for different forums of feedback (Ma¨ kitalo, Ha¨ kkinen, Leinonen, & Ja¨ rvela¨ , 2002) and levels of discussion (Jarvela & Hakkinen, 2002). The ﬁndings suggest evidence of both collegial and critical forms of discussion. Collegial discussion was found to be important in developin"

Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as ``knows'', ``believes'', and ``thinks'', when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more phil"

In support of a more systematic approach, we describe the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework. KLI promotes the emergence of instructional principles of high potential for generality, while explicitly identifying constraints of and opportunities for detailed analysis of the knowledge students may acquire in courses. Drawing on research across domains of science, math, and language learning, we illustrate the analyses of knowledge, learning, and instructional events that the KLI framework affords. We present"
