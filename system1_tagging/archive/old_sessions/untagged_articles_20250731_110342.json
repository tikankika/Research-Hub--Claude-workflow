We begin by contextualizing our topic relative to summative and formative assessment before presenting the current literature, which we categorized into the following: (a) supplementary use in classrooms, (b) web-based, and (c) data-driven, continuous CBAfL. Examples of research studies per category are provided. Findings show that using CBAfL in the classroom, via the Internet, or embedded in a game, generally enhances learning and other outcomes across a range of content areas (e.g. biology, math, and programming)"

Therefore, in this study, we propose a curriculum that teaches the ethical use of large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and verify its impact on educational effectiveness and technology acceptance among students aged 12 to 24. The validation results show that the proposed curriculum particularly contributes to the understanding of LLM concepts and their ethical use in decision support. We also demonstrate that experience using ChatGPT influences the level of understanding of ethical usage. Additionally, students aged 12 to "
