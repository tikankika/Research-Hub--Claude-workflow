Recent developments have assisted instructors in determining the strengths and weaknesses of student achievement. This understanding will benefit from adopting the necessary interventions to assist students in improving their performance, helping at-risk of failure students, and preventing dropout rates. The review analyzed 46 studies between 2019 and 2023 "
