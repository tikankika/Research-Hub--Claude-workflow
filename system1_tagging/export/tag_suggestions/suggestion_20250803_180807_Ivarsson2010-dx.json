With an interest in the development of competence, and, the achievement of professionally purposeful action - as this is done by way of digital technologies - the study exploits the details of a single collaborative design/learning activity among students of architecture. The provided analysis aims at informing the discussion on the role of technically mediated visual reasoning for the emerging professional vision of the to-be architects. By demonstrating the performance of visually complex actions and events - events and actions that could not have occurred outside the particular medium used - the study raises so"
